0	0	307	Molecular neuropsychiatry	Sex-Specific Effects of Stress on Mood-Related Gene Expression.	"Women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). Recent studies report distinct molecular changes in depressed men and women across mesocorticolimbic brain regions. However, it is unclear which sex-related factors drive distinct MDD-associated pathology. The goal of this study was to use mouse experimental systems to investigate sex-specific mechanisms underlying the distinct molecular profiles of MDD in men and women. We used unpredictable chronic mild stress to induce an elevated anxiety-/depressive-like state and ""four core genotypes"" (FCG) mice to probe for sex-specific mechanisms. As predicted, based on previous implications in mood, stress impacted the expression of several dopamine-, GABA-, and glutamate-related genes. Some of these effects, specifically in the prefrontal cortex, were genetic sex-specific, with effects in XX mice but not in XY mice. Stress also impacted gene expression differently across the mesocorticolimbic circuit, with increased expression of mood-related genes in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, but decreased expression in basolateral amygdala. Our results suggest that females are sensitive to the effects of chronic stress, partly due to their genetic sex, independent of gonadal hormones. Furthermore, these results point to the prefrontal cortex as the node in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry with the strongest female-specific effects."	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31312637	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312637	stress	-4110354420726924665

Disease phenotyping is a key step towards an increasingly personalized approach to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), leading to a more precise assessment, treatment and definition of disease outcomes. The search for biomarkers able to guide the identification of COPD phenotypes are of great importance for both researchers and clinicians. However, while several biomarkers of inflammation [e.g., peripheral blood eosinophils and fractional expired nitric oxide] have been identified and applied in asthma, none has been successfully linked to discrete clinical parameters of COPD such as exacerbations, natural progression, and treatment response or mortality risk. Recently, several studies have shown that blood eosinophils are a potential biomarker for patient subset stratification in COPD therapy. Here we reviewed the value of blood eosinophils in predicting the response of COPD patients to treatment.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31307853	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307853	asthma	-7292285110016212249

5	5	337	FEBS letters	Egr-1 transcriptionally activates protein phosphatase PTP1B to facilitate hyperinsulinemia-induced insulin resistance in the liver in type 2 diabetes.	During the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hyperinsulinemia is the earliest symptom. It is believed that long-term high insulin stimulation might facilitate insulin resistance in the liver, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Herein, we report that hyperinsulinemia could induce persistent early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1) activation in hepatocytes, which provides negative feedback inhibition of insulin sensitivity by inducing the expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B). Deletion of Egr-1 in the liver remarkably decreases glucose production, thus improving systemic glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Mechanistic analysis indicates that Egr-1 inhibits insulin receptor (InsR) phosphorylation by directly activating PTP1B transcription in the liver. Our results reveal the molecular mechanism by which hyperinsulinemia accelerates insulin resistance in hepatocytes during the progression of T2DM. This article is protected by copyright.

6	6	573	Revista espanola de salud publica	[Smoking control in Spain: current situation and priorities].	Este trabajo presenta un análisis estratégico de la prevención del tabaquismo en España. A partir de una revisión de la situación de la epidemia y de las políticas de prevención vigentes con los datos disponibles en el año 2019, se plantean los problemas prioritarios para mejorar la prevención del tabaquismo, proponiendo unas estrategias y acciones clave para el futuro. Considerando como grandes objetivos evitar el inicio en el tabaquismo y ayudar a los fumadores a dejar el consumo de tabaco, se valoran las diversas estrategias de actuación y las acciones clave a desarrollar. Además de ayudar a los fumadores a dejar de fumar desde los servicios sanitarios, destacan como acciones clave de prevención diversas políticas públicas como la política fiscal, la prohibición de la publicidad y otras formas de promoción, la regulación de los envases del tabaco, la generalización de los espacios sin humo, y la información a la ciudadanía sobre sus efectos perjudiciales. Algunas han seguido una evolución favorable en España, pero en otras hay amplio margen de mejora. La estrategia MPOWER de la Organización Mundial de la Salud ofrece una guía para el desarrollo de las políticas más efectivas de control del tabaquismo. A su luz, se recomienda poner énfasis en acciones relativas a ampliar las normas sobre aire limpio, en desarrollar servicios de apoyo a distancia para dejar de fumar, en realizar periódicamente campañas publicitarias de amplia cobertura para fomentar el abandono del tabaco, en reforzar el apoyo para dejar de fumar desde los servicios sanitarios, en financiar los tratamientos farmacológicos, en ampliar la prohibición de la publicidad de tabaco a los dispositivos electrónicos que liberan nicotina, y en incrementar la carga fiscal sobre el conjunto de labores de tabaco y otros productos con nicotina.	2019	spa	Journal Article	Spain	31298227	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298227	smoking	4119190424078847945
7	7	130	Diagnosis (Berlin, Germany)	Assessing diagnostic error in cerebral venous thrombosis via detailed chart review.	Background Diagnostic error in cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) has been understudied despite the harm associated with misdiagnosis of other cerebrovascular diseases as well as the known challenges of evaluating non-specific neurological symptoms in clinical practice. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of CVT patients hospitalized at a single center. Two independent reviewers used a medical record review tool, the Safer Dx Instrument, to identify diagnostic errors. Demographic and clinical factors were abstracted. We compared subjects with and without a diagnostic error using the t-test for continuous variables and the chi-square (χ2) test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables; an alpha of 0.05 was the cutoff for significance. Results A total of 72 CVT patients initially met study inclusion criteria; 19 were excluded due to incomplete medical records. Of the 53 patients included in the final analysis, the mean age was 48 years and 32 (60.4%) were women. Diagnostic error occurred in 11 cases [20.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.8-33.6%]. Subjects with diagnostic errors were younger (42 vs. 49 years, p = 0.13), more often women (81.8% vs. 54.8%, p = 0.17), and were significantly more likely to have a past medical history of a headache disorder prior to the index CVT visit (7.1% vs. 36.4%, p = 0.03). Conclusions Nearly one in five patients with complete medical records experienced a diagnostic error. Prior history of headache was the only evaluated clinical factor that was more common among those with an error in diagnosis. Future work on distinguishing primary from secondary headaches to improve diagnostic accuracy in acute neurological disease is warranted.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31271550	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271550	headache	-7926018713416777892
8	8	740	Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)	Effects of Nilvadipine on Cerebral Blood Flow in Patients With Alzheimer Disease.	Cerebrovascular changes, including reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF), occur early in the development of Alzheimer disease and may accelerate disease progression. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated how 6 months of treatment with the calcium antagonist nilvadipine would affect CBF in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease. CBF was measured with magnetic resonance arterial spin labeling in whole-brain gray matter and in a priori defined regions of interest including the hippocampus. Fifty-eight patients were randomly assigned (29 in each group), of whom 22 in both groups had no magnetic resonance exclusion criteria and were medication compliant over 6 months. Mean age was 72.8±6.2 years, mean mini-mental state examination was 20.4±3.4. Nilvadipine treatment lowered systolic blood pressure (Δ=-11.5 [95% CI, -19.7 to -3.2] mm Hg; P<0.01), while whole-brain gray-matter CBF remained stable (Δ=5.4 [95% CI, -6.4 to 17.2] mL/100 g per minute; P=0.36). CBF in the hippocampus increased (left: Δ=24.4 [95% CI, 4.3-44.5] mL/100 g per minute; P=0.02; right: Δ=20.1 [95% CI, -0.6 to 40.8] mL/100 g per minute; P=0.06). There was no significant change in CBF in the posterior cingulate cortex (Δ=5.2 [95% CI, -16.5 to 27.0] mL/100 g per minute; P=0.63) or other regions of interest. In conclusion, nilvadipine reduced blood pressure and increased CBF in the hippocampus, whereas other regions showed stable or small nonsignificant increases in CBF. These findings not only indicate preserved cerebral autoregulation in Alzheimer disease but also point toward beneficial cerebrovascular effects of antihypertensive treatment.

9	9	400	 	Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors in Regulation of Pathology of Cerebrovascular Disorders	Cerebrovascular disorders including ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage are among the major clinical concerns for which effective therapies are poorly available. Accumulating lines of evidence indicate that drugs acting on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) may provide therapeutic effects on these disorders, based on their neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory actions. For example, the cholinergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system via nAChRs may function as an endogenous neuroprotective system that prevents pathogenic events associated with ischemic stroke. On the other hand, exogenous administration of nicotine or nAChR agonists to experimental models of ischemic stroke has been reported to produce conflicting results (either protective or deleterious), which may be largely dependent on the different regiments of drug treatments. With regard to intracerebral hemorrhage, preclinical findings suggest that post-treatment with nAChR agonists is effective in alleviating brain tissue damage and neurological outcome. The beneficial actions of nAChR agonist have also been reported for an experimental model of subarachnoid hemorrhage, which should be confirmed by further investigations. Although smoking has been considered as an important risk factor for stroke episodes, specific targeting of the central nAChRs may prove to be an effective and novel strategy for the treatment of diverse types of cerebrovascular disorders.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314414	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314414	smoking	-9157338616628196758
10	10	319	Vaccine	Temporal trends in anti-vaccine discourse on Twitter.	Despite vaccination's role in preventing communicable diseases, misinformation threatens uptake. Social media may disseminate such anti-vaccination messages. We characterized trends in pro- and anti-vaccination discourse on Twitter. All tweets between 2010 and 2019 containing vaccine-related hashtags were identified. Pro- and anti-vaccine tweets and users per quarter (3-months) were tabulated; discussion subcommunities were identified with network analysis. 1,637,712 vaccine-related tweets were identified from 154 pro-vaccine and 125 anti-vaccine hashtags, with 86% of users posting exclusively pro-vaccine and 12% posting exclusively anti-vaccine hashtags. Pro-vaccine tweet volumes are larger than anti-vaccine tweets and consistently increase over time. In contrast, anti-vaccine tweet volumes have decreased since 2014, despite an increasing anti-vaccine user-base. Users infrequently responded across pro/anti-vaccine alignment (0.2%). Despite greater volumes of pro-vaccination discourse in recent years, and the anti-vaccination content userbase being smaller, the anti-vaccine community continues to grow in size. This finding coupled with the minimal inter-communication between communities suggests possible ideological isolation.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31300292	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300292	vaccine	1805789466376069146

12	12	559	Journal of cellular and molecular medicine	Kaempferol attenuates liver fibrosis by inhibiting activin receptor-like kinase 5.	Liver fibrosis is a common public health problem. Patients with liver fibrosis are more likely to develop cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as a more serious consequence. Numerous therapeutic approaches have emerged, but the final clinical outcome remains unsatisfactory. Here, we discovered a flavonoid natural product kaempferol that could dramatically ameliorate liver fibrosis formation. Our data showed that intraperitoneal injection of kaempferol could significantly decrease the necroinflammatory scores and collagen deposition in the liver tissue. In addition, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), laminin (LN) and hyaluronic acid (HA) levels were significantly down-regulated in kaempferol treatment group compared with those in the control group. Our study also demonstrated that kaempferol markedly inhibited the synthesis of collagen and activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the results of Western blotting revealed that kaempferol could down-regulate Smad2/3 phosphorylation dose-dependently. These bioactivities of kaempferol may result from its targeted binding to the ATP-binding pocket of activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5), as suggested by the molecular docking study and LanthaScreen Eu kinase binding assay. Above all, our data indicate that kaempferol may prove to be a novel agent for the treatment of liver fibrosis or other fibroproliferative diseases.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31273920	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31273920	Cirrhosis	-5170198873410718233

14	14	58	The Pan African medical journal	[Cerebral tuberculoma a diagnostic challenge: case study and update].	Central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis is the second most common presentation after tuberculous meningitis. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing countries, accounting for 10-30% of intracranial expansive lesions in these countries against 0.2% in some Western countries. This study aims to report an atypical clinical and radiological manifestation (brain MRI and spectroscopy) of cerebral tuberculoma in order to provide an update on this infectious disease. The study involved a 44-year old female patient with no particular previous history, with headaches persisting for 1 year and complicated by partial secondarily generalized seizures and heaviness at the left hemicorpus with episodes of vomiting without visual disorder or fever or deterioration of general condition after 8 months. Clinical examination showed conscious patient with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 15, equal and reactive pupils, walking and/or standing without fault, with 4/5 left-sided hemiparesis without other neurological signs. Brain MRI objectified right parietal subtentorial plurilobulated isointense poorly differentiated lesion on T1 weighted sequence without contrast agents injection and heterogeneous lesion with hyperintense edge and hypointense fundus, suggesting fleshy process with areas of central necrosis and perilesionnal edema extending in finger-like fashion with intense annular enhancement after gadolinium injection on T2 weighted sequence. Spectroscopy showed glial tumor. The patient received anticonvulsant therapy and macroscopic complete resection. Anatomopathologic analysis showed cerebral tuberculoma. She received antituberculosis drugs with seizure stoppage and deficit recovery after 4 weeks. This study highlights the clinical and radiological polymorphism of cerebral tuberculoma. This is suspected based on laboratory tests as well as on a body of clinical and radiological evidences but definitive diagnosis is based on anatomopathologic analysis. Early management is essential because complications can be severe and result in a poor prognosis.	2019	fre	English Abstract	Uganda	31303945	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303945	tuberculosis	4988225165850707692

Die Tuberkulose stellt mit jährlich 10 Millionen neuen Fällen und über einer Million Toten im Jahr ein zentrales globales Problem dar. Eine Knochentuberkulose stellt dem gegenüber als extrem selten auftretende Form der Tuberkulose eine besondere Herausforderung hinsichtlich der Diagnosestellung sowie der Sanierung und Defektdeckung von tiefgreifenden Defekten im Bereich der Extremitäten dar. Für Mitteleuropa stellt sich vor dem Hintergrund vermehrter Migration und ansteigender Zahlen von Tuberkulosefällen verstärkt die Frage nach einer sicheren Diagnose, Therapie und Schutzmaßnahmen im Umgang mit dem Patienten.Im vorliegenden Fall, einer 49-jährigen Frau aus Pakistan, erfolgte eine erstmalige Vorstellung mit dem klinischen Bild eines Exanthems auf Höhe des oberen Sprunggelenkes mit radiologischen Zeichen einer Osteolyse. Die pathologische und molekularpathologische Diagnostik erbrachte den Nachweis einer Infektion durch einen Erreger des M. tuberculosis-Komplexes. In der Initialphase über 6 Wochen erfolgte die leitliniengerechte 4fach-Therapie mit Isoniazid (INH), Rifampicin (RMP), Pyrazinamid (PZA) und Ethambutol (EMB) und in der anschließenden Kontinuitätsphase die 2fach-Therapie mit INH und RMP für 12 Monate.14 Monate später, erfolgte bei Rezidiv-Abszess die erneute stationäre Aufnahme, mit der Fortführung der tuberkulostatischen Therapie als Vierfach-Kombination aus INH, RMP, PZA und EMB für 6 Wochen und als Zweifachkombination INH und RMP für insgesamt ein Jahr.Nach Sanierung des Abszesses erfolgte die Ruhigstellung des Gelenkes mittels Sprunggelenks-Arthrodese und schließlich die Defektdeckung der tiefgreifenden Nekrose am rechten Sprunggelenk durch einen freien M. gracilis-Lappenplastik durch die Plastische Chirurgie.In dem hier beschriebenen Fall erfolgte die suffiziente ossäre Versorgung sowie Weichgewebsdeckung in einem Schwerpunktkrankenhaus durch die Zusammenarbeit der Infektiologie, der orthopädisch-unfallchirurgischen und der plastisch-chirurgischen Abteilung. Der knöcherne Defekt konnte so saniert, der Weichgewebsdefekt gedeckt und letztlich der Extremitätenerhalt gesichert werden. Im Rahmen dieses Fallbeispiels soll aufgrund der zunehmenden Relevanz dieser Entität ein umfassender Überblick über die relevante aktuelle Literatur gegeben werden und ein Therapie-Algorithmus abgeleitet werden.	2019	ger	Journal Article	Germany	31311057	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311057	tuberculosis	-5917314377186856799

"Background In order to achieve patient adherence, individuals require different levels of information. Basic and adequate information must be provided by different health care providers to patients. Objective To assess the information level of patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to determine the source of their information regarding the medicine they use in addition to their satisfaction, inhalation usage techniques and perception of the information providing role of health care professionals. Setting Respiratory disease clinics in Nicosia and Famagusta state hospitals and community pharmacies in North Cyprus. Method A cross-sectional multicentered observational study was carried out in respiratory disease clinics and community pharmacies. Patients' knowledge and healthcare providers' perceptions of their roles were evaluated using ""The satisfaction with information about medicines scale"". Evaluation of patient's inhalation techniques was performed using a validated checklist. Main outcome measure (a) Patients' knowledge of their medication and satisfaction with the information provided by health care professionals, (b) the prevalence of critical inhalation mistakes, (c) health care professionals' perceptions of their patient counseling practice. Results A total of 110 patients were evaluated, and 6 physicians and 76 pharmacists were recruited for the interview. The health care professionals reported that they talk about the action and the use of medicines with the patients. The standardized average patients' satisfaction score for action and use was 0.35 (± 0.21), whereas for potential side effects, it was 0.26 (± 0.15). Even though 92% of patients believed that they use their inhaler properly, 75% of the patients made at least one critical mistake while using the inhalation demo, which would likely affect the delivery of the medicine to the lungs. Conclusion In spite of health care professionals feeling comfortable with their counseling practices, the majority of patients reported dissatisfaction with the information they provided about medicine, and three out of four patients were making critical mistakes in the use of inhalers. More effort is warranted by health care professionals on patient education to limit critical mistakes."	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31313004	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313004	asthma	6157037646878010131

Renal physiology	Analysis of Continence Reflexes by Dynamic Urethral Pressure Recordings in a Rat Sress Urinary Incontinence Model induced by Multiple Simulated Birth Traumas.	This study evaluated the real-time changes in urethral pressure during the storage phase using a rat model with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) induced by simulated multiple birth traumas, and investigated the relationship between urethral continence function and dynamic parameters associated with the changes in urethral pressure. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into sham and 3-times vaginal distention (VD) groups. After transection of T8-9 spinal cord, simultaneous bladder and urethral pressure recordings were performed during intravesical pressure elevation. Then, urodynamic parameters such as leak point pressure (LPP), urethral baseline pressure (UBP), maximum urethral pressure (MUP), the MUP-UBP differential (dUP) during intravesical pressure elevation, the bladder pressure when urethral contraction begins (Puc), and the bladder pressure at bladder neck opening (Pno) were measured and compared. Compared with sham group, LPP, UBP, dUP, MUP, Puc, and Pno were significantly decreased in VD group. The pressure differences between LPP and Pno (LPP-Pno), and between LPP and UBP (LPP-UBP) were also significantly different in two groups. However, the difference values of LPP and MUP (LPP-MUP) or Pno and UBP (Pno-UBP) were not altered after VD. Our new methods of simultaneous recordings of dynamic changes in bladder and urethral pressures are useful to fully evaluate the functional alterations in the urethral continence function in the SUI model induced by multiple VD. Moreover, LPP-UBP values, which corresponds to Valsalva LPP (VLPP)-maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP) in clinical urodynamics, would be useful to evaluate the impaired urethral continence function after simulated birth traumas in animal models.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313954	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313954	stress	6023609667389715259

Ageratina adenophora is a noxious plant and it is known to cause acute asthma, diarrhea, depilation, and even death in livestock (Zhu et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2017). A. adenophora grows near roadsides and degraded land worldwide (He et al., 2015b). In the areas where it grows, A. adenophora is an invasive species that inhibits the growth of local plants and causes poisoning in animals that come in contact with it (Nie et al., 2012). In China, these plants can be found in Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Chongqing, and other southwestern areas (He et al., 2015a) and they have become a dominant species in these local regions. It threatens the native biodiversity and ecosystem in the invaded areas and causes serious economic losses (Wang et al., 2017). It has been reported that A. adenophora can grow in the northeast direction at a speed of 20 km per year in China (Guo et al., 2009). Because of the damage caused by A. adenophora, it ranks among the earliest alien invasive plant species in China (Wang et al., 2017).	2019	eng	Journal Article	China	31273967	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31273967	Diarrhea	-3173020603774823976

A 27-year-old male was presented with a decrease in vision in the left eye. Best-corrected visual acuity was 10/10 in the right eye and counting fingers at 2 m in the left eye. On fundus examination, the left optic disc was oedematous and there was a wide yellowish, well-defined placoid lesion between the temporal vascular arcades with mild vitreous inflammation. However, a small yellowish well-defined placoid lesion was detected in the inferior temporal region of the macula in the right eye. He was diagnosed with posterior placoid chorioretinopathy (PPC), papillitis, and neurosyphilis after performing fundus fluorescein angiography, fundus autofluorescence imaging, optical coherence tomography, serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis, and cerebrospinal fluid examination. Intravenous penicillin treatment was commenced as soon as the diagnosis was established. Seven days after treatment initiation, lesions were partially regressed. PPC and papillitis are rare manifestations of ocular syphilis. In addition, neurosyphilis may also accompany these manifestations. Therefore, syphilis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients who have PPC or papillitis and all patients should be tested for HIV coinfection and neurosyphilis.	2019	eng	Case Reports	England	31312245	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312245	HIV	-9107331682787867601

Transition to chronic kidney disease (CKD) after an episode of acute kidney injury (AKI) is known in patients without cirrhosis. We studied the incidence and risk factors for development of CKD in cirrhosis patients. Competing risk analysis was performed to identify risk factors for CKD development. Of 818 patients with cirrhosis (age 50.4 ± 11.8 years; 84% males; Model for End-Stage Liver Disease [MELD] 19.9 ± 9.9), 36% had AKI at enrollment, 27% had prior AKI, and 61% developed new episodes of AKI during the follow-up period. CKD developed in 269 (33%) patients. Serum CysC (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] 1.58, 1.07-2.33), episodes of prior AKI (SHR 1.26, 1.02-1.56), and AKI stage at enrollment (no AKI [SHR 1] vs. stage 1 [SHR 3.28, 1.30-8.25] vs. stage 2 [SHR 4.33, 1.76-10.66] vs. stage 3 [SHR 4.5, 1.59-12.73]) were identified as baseline risk factors for CKD development. On time-varying competing risk analysis, MELD (SHR 1.01, 1-1.03), number of AKI episodes (SHR 1.25, 1.15-1.37), and CysC (SHR 1.38, 1.01-1.89) predicted CKD development. Development of CKD was associated with higher risk of death. Reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) not meeting CKD criteria was seen in 66% of patients with cirrhosis, more so in those with previous AKI episodes and a high CysC level and MELD score. Renal histology available in 55 patients, showed tubulointerstitial injury in 86%, cholemic nephrosis in 29%, and glomerular changes in 38%. CONCLUSION: Almost two-thirds of patients with cirrhosis develop episodes of AKI and reduction in GFR; a third progress to CKD, resulting in adverse outcomes. Higher MELD and CysC levels and number of AKI episodes predict development of CKD in patients with cirrhosis. This article is protected by copyright.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is emerging as a major threat to healthy aging among people with HIV (PHIV). PHIV face heightened risks for coronary heart disease (CHD)/myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF), fueled by systemic immune activation and by metabolic dysregulation. Women with HIV (WHIV) evidence unique patterns of vascular and myocardial pathology as compared to men with HIV (MHIV). These patterns include a predilection to microvascular dysfunction and type II MI, as well as a penchant for diastolic dysfunction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Investigations are underway to understand how advanced reproductive aging among WHIV influences systemic immune activation and metabolic dysregulation en route to these CVD phenotypes. A key goal is to identify targeted CVD prevention strategies relevant to WHIV, particularly as efficacious treatment approaches to type II MI and HFpEF are lacking.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31309321	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309321	heart+disease	5822211783543822544

Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is the only available point of care test to assess type-2 inflammation in asthma. In making a diagnosis of asthma, FeNO should be used together with blood eosinophils and spirometry, alongside a history. Raised FeNO in conjunction with blood eosinophilia are treatable traits of type 2 inflammation in asthma, which in turn may guide personalised management. A FeNO suppression test can be used to assess adherence and device use with ICS therapy. Furthermore FeNO may be used to provide feedback to patients in response to ICS, especially when spirometry is normal. FeNO may facilitate appropriate referral to secondary care for more definitive specialist investigations. In summary, FeNO is cost effective in the diagnosis and management of asthma and should be incorporated into primary and secondary care as part of routine clinical practice.	2019	eng	Review	England	31299469	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299469	asthma	6152652267138213180

The association between psychotic illness and poor physical health is now clearly articulated in the literature. By contrast the impact of depression and/or anxiety on physical health is considerably less understood, despite depression being the leading cause of disability worldwide and is associated with significantly higher prevalence of physical comorbidities than found in the general population. An Australia national cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted to ascertain the prevalence of chronic physical health conditions in persons with, and without depression and/or anxiety, allowing for demographic characteristics and lifestyle factors. The telephone-based survey was conducted using trained interviewers. Survey questions included those eliciting information about demographics, health status, and health behaviours. Independent t-tests and chi square tests showed demographic, health behaviours, and physical illness differed between those with and without depression and/or anxiety. Heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, cancer, arthritis, chronic neck and/or back pain, and asthma were significantly higher in participants diagnosed with depression and/or anxiety. Binary logistic regression showed the strongest predictor of chronic illness was having a diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety. Depression and anxiety present major health problems impacting a considerable proportion of the population. A greater understanding of the associated physical health issues should provide impetus to broaden the physical health and mental illness research agenda to include these diagnoses.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31283353	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31283353	asthma	9032993320407723266

46	46	591	Cells	Mucosa-Environment Interactions in the Pathogenesis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.	Mucosal surfaces play a central role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Several risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, environmental pollution, and periodontitis interact with the host at the mucosal level, triggering immune system activation. Moreover, the alteration of microbiota homeostasis is gaining increased attention for its involvement in the disease pathogenesis, modulating the immune cell response at a local and subsequently at a systemic level. Currently, the onset of the clinical manifest arthritis is thought to be the last step of a series of pathogenic events lasting years. The positivity for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) and rheumatoid factor (RF), in absence of symptoms, characterizes a preclinical phase of RA-namely systemic autoimmune phase- which is at high risk for disease progression. Several immune abnormalities, such as local ACPA production, increased T cell polarization towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype, and innate immune cell activation can be documented in at-risk subjects. Many of these abnormalities are direct consequences of the interaction between the environment and the host, which takes place at the mucosal level. The purpose of this review is to describe the humoral and cellular immune abnormalities detected in subjects at risk of RA, highlighting their origin from the mucosa-environment interaction.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31295951	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295951	smoking	-4994468824009200256

Background Few studies have reported on the diagnostic performance of Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) LR-5 or LR-5 V in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using MRI with gadoxetate disodium. Purpose To determine the diagnostic performance of LI-RADS version 2018 (hereafter, v2018) on gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI in comparison with LI-RADS version 2017 (hereafter, v2017) for the diagnosis of HCC in patients with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B viral infection or at high risk for HCC. Materials and Methods This retrospective study between January 2013 and October 2015 evaluated consecutive patients at high risk for HCC who had at least one observation of 10 mm or greater on gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI and no history of previous treatment for hepatic lesions. MRI features were reviewed by three radiologists. Observations were categorized according to LI-RADS v2018 and LI-RADS v2017.

And within that state, the 38 counties comprising South Texas--a highly populated, largely Hispanic area characterized by high uninsured rates and low numbers of health care providers--are emblematic of nationwide crises in public health. The South Texas Health Status Review: A Health Disparities Roadmap brings health care disparities to light in instructive detail. Over thirty key health conditions and risk factors, such as breast cancer, diabetes, obesity, tuberculosis, smoking and alcohol use, lead exposure, birth defects, and homicide rates, are analyzed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and location (urban or rural), and the results compared with the rest of Texas and the nation as a whole. A section on conclusions and recommendations outlines factors contributing to these conditions and offers suggestions for improvement. These important data should stimulate further population studies and provide impetus for targeted public health interventions and community outreach programs to reduce health inequities and advance care access in the state and the U.S. at large. Major health issues covered in the report include: • Communicable diseases • Cancer incidence and mortality • Maternal and child health • Chronic diseases • Behavioral risk factors in adults • Environmental health issues • Suicide, homicide, and vehicular mortality. The South Texas Health Status Review contains valuable lessons for researchers in health promotion and health disparities, as well as community health professionals. Policymakers involved in reducing health disparities will find it especially useful.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314218	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314218	obesity	1933229167501870037

Racism and race-related stress can negatively impact the mental health status of ethnic minorities. In recent years, college campuses have held demonstrations to promote awareness regarding racism and to call for resources to help improve campus climate and to address the needs of students of color. This study answers this call by developing and evaluating the benefits of a peer-led compassionate meditation program to help students of color heal from race-related stress. To date, no studies have examined whether compassionate meditation (a specific type of meditation) can be used as a therapeutic tool to address racial stress. This article discusses the formative process for developing and pilot-testing the effects of this culturally responsive 8-session compassionate meditation program with Asian American college students. Despite a small sample size, results were promising. and participants evidenced decreases in general distress, as well as depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Moreover, by the end of the program, fewer students were clinically depressed. The results of this study provide some initial evidence that brief, culturally responsive compassionate meditation interventions may be a promising and cost-effective method for addressing the impact of racism and race-related stress.

82	82	286	Stem cells and development	Expansion and Maintenance of CD133-Expressing Pancreatic Ductal Epithelial Cells via Inhibition of Transforming Growth Factor-β Signaling.	Restoring β-cell mass by the transplantation of pancreatic islets is an effective diabetes treatment, but it is limited by the shortage of donor organs. CD133-expressing pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (PDECs) have the ability to generate insulin-producing cells. The expansion of these cells is dependent on extrinsic niche factors, but few of those signals have been identified. In this study, CD133-expressing PDECs were purified by sorting from adult wild-type C57BL/6 mice and TGFβRIInull/null mice. Furthermore, using immunofluorescence and transplantation assays, we found that the inhibition of the TGF-β pathway promoted the expansion of CD133-expressing PDECs for many generations and maintained the ability of CD133-expressing PDECs to generate insulin-producing cells. Moreover, western blot, qRT-PCR, and dual luciferase assays using TGF-β inhibitors were performed to identify the mechanisms by which TGF-β signaling regulates proliferation and differentiation. The results showed that the inhibition of TGF-β signaling enhanced Id2 binding to the promoter region of the cell proliferation repressor p16 and promoted the expansion of CD133-expressing PDECs, and the increased Id2 binding to NeuroD1 decreased the transcription of Pax6 to maintain CD133-expressing PDECs in the Pdx1-expression stage. Taken together, the effect of TGF-β antagonists on CD133-expressing PDECs reveals a novel paradigm of signaling that explains the balance between the expansion and differentiation of pancreatic duct epithelial progenitors.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31311463	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311463	diabetes	7420742904084384944

In a large cutaneous melanoma population we explored whether the known clinical risk factors for melanoma susceptibility (nevus phenotype, phototype, family and personal history of melanoma and sun damage) affect melanoma outcomes. A total of 1,530 melanoma patients were included. Multivariable analysis adjusted for age, gender, melanoma stage, localization and subtype showed that familial melanoma, solar lentigines on head and neck, the back of hands, arms and shoulders were associated with a better relapse free survival. The presence of atypical naevi was associated with an increased risk of relapse. After Bonferroni correction, the correlation between presence of solar lentigines on the back of the hands and arms remained the most robust and significant prognostic factor for the relapse free survival in cutaneous melanoma patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Sweden	31314121	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314121	cancer	8219310215587599928

86	86	727	Molecular and biochemical parasitology	Hookworm infection aggravates metabolic disorder in obesity.	Obesity and ancylostomiasis are considered public health problems. Recent studies have shown that infection by intestinal helminths in obese individuals can ameliorate metabolic disorder and improve glucose tolerance by decreasing both insulin resistance and low-intensity inflammation. However, few helminth species have been studied in this context, and some modulation mechanisms still require deeper investigation. Therefore, the present work aimed to investigate the role of experimental infection with Ancylostoma ceylanicum in the modulation of the immune response in an obese experimental model. Four groups of hamsters were used as follows: two groups were submitted to a hyperlipidic and hypercaloric diet capable of inducing obesity, one infected and the other uninfected; and two normonourished control groups, one infected and one uninfected by A. ceylanicum. Biochemical, haematological, parasitological and immunological parameters were evaluated. The results demonstrated that A. ceylanicum infection accentuated weight loss in obese animals compared to normonourished animals. However, obesity reduced the recovery of worms and oviposition of the females, and both infected groups showed decreased levels of haemoglobin, albumin, iron and erythrocytes. Significant relations were observed for pathogenesis in the following cases: infection interfered in lipid metabolism, which increased levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides in the obese group, and caused a decrease in HDL levels in both groups. Obesity led to an increase in glucose levels, and the infection exacerbated this parameter in both the normonourished and obese groups. Inflammation was intensified in obese animals that showed elevated macrophage and neutrophil activation in adipose tissue, enlargement of the spleen and accumulation of lipids in the liver and faeces. Despite the decrease in IFN-γ levels, the infection did not potentiated the expression of the Foxp3, IL-10 and IL-2 transcription factor for any of the infected groups, markers that could positively compensate the host from the damage caused by obesity.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31306675	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306675	obesity	8565115980515859979

Despite the fact that iron represents a crucial element for the catalysis of many metabolic reactions, its accumulation in the cell leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), provoking pathological conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and fertility. Thus, ROS are neutralized by the enzymatic antioxidant system for the purpose of protecting cells against any damage. Iron is a potential risk factor for male fertility. However, the mechanism of action of iron on the testicular antioxidant system at the gene and protein levels is not fully understood. Thus, the purpose of the current research was to ensure a better understanding of how the long-term iron treatment influences both gene expression and enzyme activities of the testicular antioxidant system in rat testis. The data of our study showed that a significant dose-dependent increase occurred in the iron level in rat testis. A reduction occurred in reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, which represent a marker of oxidative stress, along with long-term iron overload. The expression and activity of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6pd), glutathione reductase (Gr), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), and glutathione S-transferases (Gst) were significantly affected by the presence of iron. The findings of the current research demonstrate that the long-term toxic dietary iron overload influences the gene expression and enzyme activity of the testicular antioxidant defense system, but the actual effect occurs at the protein level. This may modify the sperm function and dysfunction of the male reproductive system.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31309445	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309445	diabetes	-9172673334835262304

Rabies is a neglected disease with an estimated annual mortality of 55,000 human deaths, affecting mainly low-income countries. Over 95% of these cases result from virus transmission through the bite of infected dogs and for this reason there is a real need for a cheap and effective rabies veterinary vaccine to be used in mass vaccination campaigns. In this work, we describe the establishment of a simple platform for the production of a virus-like particles based rabies vaccine using mammalian cells and roller bottles as culture system. Adherent cells were cultured during more than 15 days and VLPs were continuously produced and secreted to the culture supernatant. Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of VLPs were tested through rabies virus neutralizing antibody test and NIH potency test. These viral particles induced high titer of long lasting neutralizing antibodies and protected mice against active virus challenge. Therefore, this development represents a promising platform for the production of a new generation and virus-free rabies vaccine candidate for veterinary applications.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31300130	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300130	vaccine	-1039912738963181810

In proteomics, peptide information within mass spectrometry (MS) data from a specific organism sample is routinely matched against a protein sequence database that best represent such organism. However, if the species/strain in the sample is unknown or genetically poorly characterized, it becomes challenging to determine a database which can represent such sample. Building customized protein sequence databases merging multiple strains for a given species has become a strategy to overcome such restrictions. However, as more genetic information is publicly available and interesting genetic features such as the existence of pan- and core genes within a species are revealed, we questioned how efficient such merging strategies are to report relevant information. To test this assumption, we constructed databases containing conserved and unique sequences for 10 different species. Features that are relevant for probabilistic-based protein identification by proteomics were then monitored. As expected, increase in database complexity correlates with pangenomic complexity.

105	105	44	PloS one	Image processing for AFB segmentation in bacilloscopies of pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosis.	Image segmentation applied to medical image analysis is still a critical and important task. Although there exist several segmentation algorithms that have been widely studied in literature, these are subject to segmentation problems such as over- and under-segmentation as well as non-closed edges. In this paper, a simple method that combines well-known segmentation algorithms is presented. This method is applied to detect acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in bacilloscopies used to diagnose pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). This diagnosis can be performed through different tests, and the most used worldwide is smear microscopy because of its low cost and effectiveness. This diagnosis technique is based on the analysis and counting of the bacilli in the bacilloscopy observed under an optical microscope. The proposed method is used to segment the bacilli in digital images from bacilloscopies processed using Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining. The proposed method is fast, has a low computational cost and good efficiency compared to other methods. The bacilli image segmentation is performed by image processing and analysis techniques, probability concepts and classifiers. In this work, a Bayesian classifier based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used. The segmentations' results are validated by using the Jaccard index, which indicates the efficiency of the classifier.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31306434	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306434	tuberculosis	-6133746337603876146

This study aims to evaluate the analytical performance of the BD Veritor™ rapid diagnostic assays (RDTs) for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenzaviruses when performed 24/7 at bedside by nurses in the pediatric emergency department (PED). The study was performed between 14/10/2015 and 19/03/2016 on nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) collected from children consulting at the PED of the University Hospital of Saint-Etienne for bronchiolitis (RSV detection) or flu-like syndrome (influenzaviruses A/B detection). NPAs were tested 24/7 at the PED with the RDT and then sent to the Infectious Agents Department for routine analyses, first by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), then by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) considered as the gold standard in case of discrepancy between RDT and IFA results. For RSV detection, 205 NPAs was analyzed; the overall concordance between RDT and routine assays was of 97.6% (200/205). The sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) were of 97.6% (160/164), 97.6% (40/41), 90.9% (40/44) and 99.4% (160/161), respectively. A total of 419 NPA was tested for influenzaviruses. For influenzavirus A, the overall concordance was of 98.8% (414/419); Se, Sp, NPV and PPV were of 100% (41/41), 98.7% (373/378), 100% (373/373) and 89.1% (41/46), respectively. For influenzavirus B, the overall concordance was of 97.9% (410/419); Se, Sp, NPV and PPV were of 96.6% (172/178), 98.8% (238/241), 97.5% (238/244) and 98.3% (172/175), respectively. Due to their excellent performances and their easy handle by non-laboratory personnel, these RDTs can be warmly recommended as point of care assays at the PED.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31047969	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31047969	flu	5191381587333696286

The aim of this study was to determine clinical recrudescent risk factors of 477 patients with newly discovered nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) (Ta-T1) in our hospital, and based on these factors, to establish a recurrence risk prediction model of each NMIBC patient.This study included 477 patients with newly discovered NMIBC (Ta-T1) from January 2012 to December 2016; all patients were treated surgically by transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). The outcomes of patients were with or without recurrence within 2 years. The nomograms were based on Cox regression analyses, and the calibration curves were founded to evaluate the agreements of the predicted probability with the actual observed probability.Of the 477 patients with NMIBC, 392 were males (82.2%) and 85 were females (17.8%), with median age 64 years. Recurrence was identified in 327 cases (68.6%). The results showed that old age, female sex, smoking history, large size of tumor, multifocal tumors, high grade, and high stage are risk factors for NMIBC recurrence, whereas no significant association was seen between tumor location and recurrence in our study. Based on the results of Cox regression analyses, several independent risk factors, including smoking history, tumor size, multifocal, immediate infusion therapy, T stage, and tumor grade, were used to establish a nomogram to calculate the recurrence probability of each NMIBC patient, and the calibration curve displayed that this nomogram had a great value of prediction.Old age, female sex, smoking history, large size of tumor, multifocal tumors, high grade, and high stage are risk factors for NMIBC recurrence, whereas immediate infusion therapy is a protective factor. And a nomogram was established as a prediction model to calculate the recurrence probability of NMIBC patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31305463	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305463	smoking	-3810375613673461625

114	114	49	Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE	Use of the Invertebrate Galleria mellonella as an Infection Model to Study the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex.	Tuberculosis is the leading global cause of infectious disease mortality and roughly a quarter of the world's population is believed to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Despite decades of research, many of the mechanisms behind the success of M. tuberculosis as a pathogenic organism remain to be investigated, and the development of safer, more effective antimycobacterial drugs are urgently needed to tackle the rise and spread of drug resistant tuberculosis. However, the progression of tuberculosis research is bottlenecked by traditional mammalian infection models that are expensive, time consuming, and ethically challenging. Previously we established the larvae of the insect Galleria mellonella (greater wax moth) as a novel, reproducible, low cost, high-throughput and ethically acceptable infection model for members of the M. tuberculosis complex. Here we describe the maintenance, preparation, and infection of G. mellonella with bioluminescent Mycobacterium bovis BCG lux. Using this infection model, mycobacterial dose dependent virulence can be observed, and a rapid readout of in vivo mycobacterial burden using bioluminescence measurements is easily achievable and reproducible. Although limitations exist, such as the lack of a fully annotated genome for transcriptomic analysis, ontological analysis against genetically similar insects can be carried out. As a low cost, rapid, and ethically acceptable model for tuberculosis, G. mellonella can be used as a pre-screen to determine drug efficacy and toxicity, and to determine comparative mycobacterial virulence prior to the use of conventional mammalian models. The use of the G. mellonella-mycobacteria model will lead to a reduction in the substantial number of animals currently used in tuberculosis research.	2019	eng	Video-Audio Media	United States	31305513	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305513	tuberculosis	2690205894709699741

A sailor for forty-two years, in military service on the Italian aircraft carrier, while on a mission in sub-Saharan Africa, came to a physician due to fatigue with a fever, flu-like illness and headache for 6 days. The temperature was 38.8°C, BP 80/145 mmHg and RR 30/min. The oxygen saturation was 88%, while the patient was breathing room air. Laboratory findings showed that WBC count and platelet counts were greatly reduced. Blood smears were positive for Plasmodium falciparum malaria with more than 10 parasites per field. It began immediately antimalarial treatment. After 24 hours the patient showed a 50% reduction in parasitemia but continued to have tachypnoea, dyspnea and hypoxemia. A chest TC scan was then performed that revealed a right basal alveolar consolidation with bilateral pleural effusion. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with pneumonia and malaria (overlap syndrome). The patient began antibiotic and steroid therapy. After two days the fever was gone away and the clinical condition of the patient was greatly improved. The clinical overlap between pneumonia and malaria has important implications for case management strategies and their treatment should be integrated into community case management activities.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Italy	30968670	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968670	flu	-8773118241761372618
116	116	67	Journal of dairy science	Short communication: Mycolicibacterium smegmatis, basonym Mycobacterium smegmatis, causing pyogranulomatous mastitis and its cross-reactivity in bovine (para)tuberculosis testing.	Different mycobacterial species are encountered in bovine medicine. The fastidiously growing mycobacteria (Mycobacterium bovis as the cause of bovine tuberculosis, and Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, MAP, as the cause of paratuberculosis) are well known and targeted in eradication/control or monitoring programs in different countries, whereas the rapidly growing species is only rarely identified from bovine disease. The latter have occasionally been reported as the cause of bovine clinical mastitis, but recent reports are scarce. In this study, Mycolicibacterium smegmatis (basonym Mycobacterium smegmatis) was identified as cause of granulomatous, relapsing clinical mastitis in 2 cows from one Belgian dairy herd. Milk, blood, and fecal samples were collected, as well as tissue samples after the cows were culled. Serological analysis conducted on milk and serum samples resulted in positive reactions for MAP, but negative for Mycobacterium bovis. Production of IFN-γ showed sensitization with mycobacteria or similar organisms, other than M. bovis, in one cow. Detection of MAP by bacteriological culture and IS900-based quantitative PCR on milk and feces remained negative. In conclusion, this paper describes M. smegmatis as a cause of bovine clinical mastitis in Belgium and suggests cross-reactivity of the intramammary M. smegmatis infection with routinely used serological tests for MAP.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31301842	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301842	tuberculosis	-7315032288233856709
117	117	747	DNA and cell biology	Role of microRNA in the Pathogenesis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most typical metabolic syndrome in women of reproductive age, with a high prevalence and an increased risk of long-term complications. PCOS mainly manifests as hyperandrogenism (HA), ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries, in addition to being relevant to infertility, insulin resistance (IR), obesity, lipid abnormalities, and chronic low-grade inflammation. The etiology of this syndrome remains largely unknown. microRNAs (miRNAs), small, noncoding RNAs (nearly 22 nucleotides long), regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Abnormal miRNA levels are closely associated with the occurrence of diseases, such as diabetes, cancers, and atherosclerosis, and miRNAs can be used as predictors and diagnostic biomarkers for cancer. Interestingly, the roles of miRNAs in PCOS pathology have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Research has established that alterations in miRNA expression in women with PCOS compared with healthy women may act as noninvasive biomarkers and new therapeutic targets in PCOS. This article aims to summarize the latest research on the relationship between miRNAs and the clinical manifestations of PCOS while also providing a few mechanisms based on previous studies. Understanding the relationship between miRNAs and PCOS will provide guidance for researchers to further explore the complexity and heterogeneity of PCOS.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31305133	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305133	obesity	3193164045772142182

119	119	256	The Journal of biological chemistry	The signaling proteins GPR158 and RGS7 modulate excitability of L2/3 pyramidal neurons and control A-type potassium channel in the prelimbic cortex.	Stress profoundly affects physiological properties of neurons across brain circuits and thereby increases the risk for depression. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms mediating these effects are poorly understood. In this study we report that chronic physical restraint stress in mice decreases excitability specifically in layer 2/3 of pyramidal neurons within the prelimbic subarea of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) accompanied by the induction of depressive-like behavioral states. We found that a complex between G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 158 (GPR158) and regulator of G protein signaling 7 (RGS7), a regulatory GPCR signaling node recently discovered to be a key modulator of affective behaviors, plays a key role in controlling stress-induced changes in excitability in this neuronal population. Deletion of GPR158 or RGS7 enhanced excitability of layer 2/3 PFC neurons and prevented the impact of stress. Investigation of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed the A-type potassium channel Kv4.2 subunits is a molecular target of the GPR158-RGS7 complex. We further report that GPR158 physically associates with Kv4.2 channel and promotes its function by suppressing inhibitory modulation by cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation. Taken together, our observations reveal a critical mechanism that adjusts neuronal excitability in L2/3 pyramidal neurons of the PFC and may thereby modulate the effects of stress on depression.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31311860	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311860	depression	-6362758570633473480

"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) due to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is on the rise throughout the world by patients looking for ""safer"" alternatives. However, data on acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) due to CAM are lacking. In a large cohort of patients with cirrhosis, we retrospectively studied CAM-related health-seeking behavior and attempted to identify those who developed possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF. In this study, we examine the clinical, biochemical, and liver histopathologic characteristics of possible CAM-DILI-related ACLF, describe implicated CAM agents, and discuss predictors of patient outcomes. Out of 1,666 patients with cirrhosis, 68% used CAM at some point. A total of 35.7% (n = 30/84) patients presented with CAM-related DILI leading to ACLF in the whole CAM-DILI-related decompensation cohort. The most common CAM was unlabeled polyherbal Ayurvedic formulations. Of possible patients with ACLF, 63% self-medicated with CAM based on social media sharing. Mean age ± SD was 51.9 ± 9.9 years, 83% were male patients, median follow-up duration was 173 (range, 14-584) days, median Child-Turcotte-Pugh score was 13 (range, 10-14), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-sodium score was 30.1 ± 4.8, median chronic liver failure-organ failure (CLIF-C-OF) score was 11 (range, 8-14), and median CLIF-C-ACLF score was 98 (range, 87-127). Portal-based neutrophilic predominant mixed inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, autoimmune-like features, and severe cholestasis were seen on liver biopsy. Overall, 53% of patients died (median survival 194 days). Baseline overt hepatic encephalopathy and CLIF-C-OF score, total bilirubin, hyponatremia and leukocytosis, and grade of ACLF predicted 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month mortality, respectively.

124	124	401	 	Imaging of Diffuse and Inflammatory Liver Disease	The incidence of diffuse liver disease, including all causes, is increasing worldwide. On one side this is due to trends in population towards aging and obesity resulting in a higher prevalence of steatosis/steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. On the other side, inflammatory origin, especially due to viral hepatitis, is one of the primary reasons for diffuse liver disease. This chapter will describe the most common imaging features of hepatic metabolic and storage diseases, including overload with fat, iron, copper, and amyloid and diffuse neoplastic diseases. We also discuss focal and diffuse infectious and inflammatory hepatic diseases. Key imaging manifestations of fungal, granulomatous, parasitic, viral, and bacterial as well as the less common hepatic infections such as cat-scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis, and amebic disease are reviewed to avoid pitfalls in image interpretation. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides unique capabilities for noninvasive and quantitative characterization of liver tissue that rival the diagnostic utility of liver biopsies, also characteristic imaging findings with computed tomography (CT) that are useful in daily clinical routine will be discussed.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314369	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314369	Cirrhosis	8471417198703153120
125	125	785	Human molecular genetics	RNA editing alterations in a multi-ethnic Alzheimer disease cohort converge on immune and endocytic molecular pathways.	Little is known about the post-transcriptional mechanisms that modulate the genetic effects in the molecular pathways underlying Alzheimer disease (AD), and even less is known about how these changes might differ across diverse populations. RNA editing, the process that alters individual bases of RNA, may contribute to AD pathogenesis due to its roles in neuronal development and immune regulation. Here, we pursued one of the first transcriptome-wide RNA editing studies in AD by examining RNA sequencing data from individuals of both African-American (AA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) ethnicities. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing and RNA editing analysis were performed on peripheral blood specimens from 216 AD cases (105 AA, 111 NHW) and 212 gender matched controls (105 AA, 107 NHW). 449 positions in 254 genes and 723 positions in 371 genes were differentially edited in AA and NHW, respectively. While most differentially edited sites localized to different genes in AA and NHW populations, these events converged on the same pathways across both ethnicities, especially endocytic and inflammatory response pathways. Furthermore, these differentially edited sites were preferentially predicted to disrupt miRNA binding and induce nonsynonymous coding changes in genes previously associated with AD in molecular studies, including PAFAH1B2 and HNRNPA1. These findings suggest RNA editing is an important post-transcriptional regulatory program in AD pathogenesis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31162550	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162550	Alzheimer	-2711301039947937868

The phenomenology of Eating Disorders (ED) relates with altered functioning of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS). The lack of agreement in what comes to the direction and significance of such alterations is possibly due to the variability in the ED spectrum. As the stress response system is an integral part of the ANS, we propose to investigate ANS tonic variations and phasic activations in response to stressors. We hypothesize that, while using stress as a test probe, characteristic ANS dysregulations in ED may be found when considering several physiological signals measured over time, and weighted by the individual psychological profiles. In this article we describe a novel methodological approach to investigate this hypothesis with the aim of providing further clarification on the ED spectrum conceptualization. The proposed methodology has been designed to be easily integrated in clinical practice and, eventually, in daily life. The population under observation includes both patients in treatment for ED, and matched controls. The study session has the duration of 1 day, including: (1) the administration of a stress task in a controlled environment and (2) naturalistic data collection. The stress task is designed to elicit both mentally and physically driven ANS activation. The naturalistic component intends to illustrate the psychophysiology in everyday life. We use wearable devices to continuously and non-invasively measure bio-signals related to ANS functioning. This information is complemented with psychometric information from validated stress and ED scales and ecological momentary assessments. The protocol has received ethical approval and has been implemented in practice, currently accounting for 37 patients (out of 120) and 16 controls (out of 60). Ongoing work focus on the definition and implementation of a data processing pipeline to quantitatively test our hypothesis, both standard statistical methods and more exploratory machine learning approaches will be considered.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31312117	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312117	stress	5269583152423890030

130	130	295	Cancer treatment reviews	The promise of combining cancer vaccine and checkpoint blockade for treating HPV-related cancer.	Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated intraepithelial neoplasia or cancers are ideal candidates for cancer immunotherapy since HPV oncoproteins, such as E6 and E7 proteins of high-risk HPVs, could be utilized as foreign antigens. In HPV-associated cancers as well as nonviral cancers, the cancer cells may evade host immunity through the expression of immune checkpoint molecules, downregulation of human leukocyte antigen, and activation of immune regulatory cells. Because of these immune suppressive mechanisms, HPV therapeutic vaccines have shown little efficacy against HPV-associated cancers, although they have shown efficacy in treating HPV-associated intraepithelial neoplasias. Recently, checkpoint blockade emerged as a promising new treatment for solid cancers; however, these therapies have shown only modest efficacy against HPV-associated cancers. Here we reviewed literature analyzing a combinatory therapy using an immune checkpoint inhibitor and an HPV therapeutic vaccine for treating HPV-associated cancers to compensate for shortfalls of each monotherapy. Complimentary modes of T cell activation would be deployed; as vaccines would directly stimulate the T cells, while checkpoint inhibitors would do so by releasing inhibition. Some promising studies using animal models and early human clinical trials raised a possibility that such combinations may be efficacious in regressing HPV-associated cancers. Epitope spreading (the phenomenon in which non-targeted antigens become new targets of immune response) may play a critical role mechanistically. Currently ongoing studies will shed light as to whether such combination therapy would indeed be a promising new treatment paradigm. Current and future studies must also determine the adverse effect profile of such a combination treatment.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31302573	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302573	vaccine	3703141283586666995

143	143	114	Cancers	Postoperative Management in Patients with Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma.	Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare catecholamine-secreting neuroendocrine tumors of the adrenal medulla and sympathetic/parasympathetic ganglion cells, respectively. Excessive release of catecholamines leads to episodic symptoms and signs of PPGL, which include hypertension, headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis. Intraoperatively, large amounts of catecholamines are released into the bloodstream through handling and manipulation of the tumor(s). In contrast, there could also be an abrupt decline in catecholamine levels after tumor resection. Because of such binary manifestations of PPGL, patients may develop perplexing and substantially devastating cardiovascular complications during the perioperative period. These complications include hypertension, hypotension, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cerebrovascular accident. Other complications seen in the postoperative period include fever, hypoglycemia, cortisol deficiency, urinary retention, etc. In the interest of safe patient care, such emergencies require precise diagnosis and treatment. Surgeons, anesthesiologists, and intensivists must be aware of the clinical manifestations and complications associated with a sudden increase or decrease in catecholamine levels and should work closely together to be able to provide appropriate management to minimize morbidity and mortality associated with PPGLs.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31277296	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31277296	headache	-1892877682006771545

Pressurized Submarine Escape Training (PSET) physically prepares submariners to safely escape a submarine at depth. Failure to complete PSET is not a submarine service disqualification. Serious medical incidents are rare, but the safety record tradeoff has been low throughput. From 2009 to 2015, only 34% of students screened completed PSET. Students may be medically screened out of the training altogether (disqualified), or dropout during the physical training (attrite). Training records from 12,122 U.S. Navy students were used to identify factors contributing to training disqualification and attrition. Multivariate logistic regression model predictors included demographic and screening items. Association to PSET disqualification included cold/congestion/cough (ORadj 12.34), limited duty status (ORadj 4.29), Physical Readiness Test failure (ORadj 3.37), pneumonia or bronchitis in last 2 years (ORadj 3.17) and nervousness or anxiety in tight spaces (ORadj 2.37). Basic Enlisted Submarine School students were more likely to be disqualified and attrite than other submariner groups, and black/African American (ORadj 1.53) students were more likely to attrite than white students.

157	157	79	Faraday discussions	Probing the nanoscale organisation and multivalency of cell surface receptors: DNA origami nanoarrays for cellular studies with single-molecule control.	Nanoscale organisation of receptor ligands has become an important approach to study the clustering behaviour of cell-surface receptors. Biomimetic substrates fabricated via different nanopatterning strategies have so far been applied to investigate specific integrins and cell types, but without multivalent control. Here we use DNA origami to surpass the limits of current approaches and fabricate nanoarrays to study different cell adhesion processes, with nanoscale spatial resolution and single-molecule control. Notably, DNA nanostructures enable the display of receptor ligands in a highly customisable manner, with modifiable parameters including ligand number, ligand spacing and most importantly, multivalency. To test the adaptability and robustness of the system we combined it with focused ion beam and electron-beam lithography nanopatterning to additionally control the distance between the origami structures (i.e. receptor clusters). Moreover, we demonstrate how the platform can be used to interrogate two different biological questions: (1) the cooperative effect of integrin and growth factor receptor in cancer cell spreading, and (2) the role of integrin clustering in cardiomyocyte adhesion and maturation. Thereby we find previously unknown clustering behaviour of different integrins, further outlining the importance for such customisable platforms for future investigations of specific receptor organisation at the nanoscale.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31314021	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314021	cancer	-7367898111498277224

159	159	15	Scientific reports	Identification and Characterization of Genetic Determinants of Isoniazid and Rifampicin Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Southern India.	Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), one of the leading causes of death worldwide, arises mainly from spontaneous mutations in the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. There is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms by which the mutations confer resistance in order to identify new drug targets and to design new drugs. Previous studies have reported numerous mutations that confer resistance to anti-TB drugs, but there has been little systematic analysis to understand their genetic background and the potential impacts on the drug target stability and/or interactions. Here, we report the analysis of whole-genome sequence data for 98 clinical M. tuberculosis isolates from a city in southern India. The collection was screened for phenotypic resistance and sequenced to mine the genetic mutations conferring resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin. The most frequent mutation among isoniazid and rifampicin isolates was S315T in katG and S450L in rpoB respectively. The impacts of mutations on protein stability, protein-protein interactions and protein-ligand interactions were analysed using both statistical and machine-learning approaches. Drug-resistant mutations were predicted not only to target active sites in an orthosteric manner, but also to act through allosteric mechanisms arising from distant sites, sometimes at the protein-protein interface.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31311987	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311987	tuberculosis	8049518593334748695

Base on the practical of MSTN-specific yeast-based protein vaccine in mice as described previously, this research was designed for developing a better DNA vaccine (a cascade of shIL21-MSTN yeast-based DNA vaccine) than solely MSTN yeast-based DNA vaccine to block the endogenous MSTN in the murine model. We first constructed the target vectors, including CMV-driven MSTN expression vector and a combined shIL21-MSTN vector which containing MSTN expression cassette and shIL21 (short hairpin RNA-IL21) expression cassette. After necessary validation, recombinant yeast vaccines harboring different vectors were well prepared. Subsequently, after 2-month administration, the MSTN-specific immune response was detected with western blots. The commercial ELISA assays indicated that the production of IL21 and IL6 were decreased compared with control groups. More importantly, the MSTN-specific antibody titer was much higher in the shIL21-MSTN group than MSTN group, which was consistent with the western blots result. The most important finding was significant body mass increased after oral administration of these yeast-based DNA vaccines, in which the shIL21-MSTN vaccine is slightly higher than the sole MSTN vaccine in mice. In this study, we confirmed the role of different MSTN-specific yeast-based DNA vaccines on increasing body mass in mice, to provide a good inspiration for livestock breeding through the new type of immunoregulatory method. On the other hand, we also detected the possible modulating role of shIL21 on the dendritic cell-mediated immune function which needs more practical application and deeper exploration.	2019	eng	Journal Article	France	31302418	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302418	vaccine	-5989749314869037016

A spinal CSF-venous fistula is one of three specific types of spinal CSF leak that can be seen in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). They are best demonstrated on specialized imaging, such as digital subtraction myelography (DSM) or dynamic myelography, but often they are diagnosed on the basis of increased contrast density in the draining veins (the so-called hyperdense paraspinal vein sign) on early postmyelography CT scans. The authors report on 2 patients who underwent directed treatment (surgery in one patient and glue injection in the other) based on the hyperdense paraspinal vein sign, in whom the actual site of the fistula did not correspond to the level or laterality of the hyperdense paraspinal vein sign. The authors suggest consideration of DSM or dynamic myelography prior to undertaking treatment directed at these fistulas.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31277063	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31277063	headache	4296604388230897073
170	170	320	Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses	Perspectives of Childhood Cancer Symptom-Related Distress: Results of the State of the Science Survey.	Management of symptom-related distress is an important area of pediatric oncology nursing. Participants who attended the Children's Oncology Group (COG) State of the Science Symposium on symptom distress completed an anonymous survey. The purpose was to explore participant perceptions of symptom distress experienced by children receiving cancer treatment on clinical trials, determine how symptom distress is currently assessed at COG institutions, and to identify what interventions are used to reduce symptom distress for these children. Among the 90 symposium attendees, 72% completed the survey, the majority (92%) of whom were nurses. The five most distressing symptoms in children with cancer enrolled on clinical trials identified by survey respondents were nausea/vomiting, fatigue, pain, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Results from our survey also suggest that symptom distress may differ by disease type. For example, symptoms associated with leukemia/lymphoma included steroid side effects, procedural pain, and neuropathy. The majority of respondents (90%) also reported that symptoms go unrecognized by health care providers. The most commonly described unrecognized symptoms were behavioral (i.e., sadness, anxiety, fear, depression, and emotional needs; 45%) and fatigue (19%). Key focus areas reported by respondents included informal and inconsistent symptom assessment, the need for uniform measurement tools, and improved documentation of symptom-related distress. Management of symptom-related distress is an important aspect of pediatric oncology nursing. Further exploration of symptom distress experienced by children with specific types of cancers, and the development of standardized symptom assessment processes, will provide a foundation for developing future interventions aimed at alleviating symptom-related distress.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31307322	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307322	depression	-3709378389941441506

The recent availability of somatic haploid cell lines has provided a unique tool for genetic studies in mammals. However, the percentage of haploid cells rapidly decreases in these cell lines, which we recently showed is due to their overgrowth by diploid cells present in the cultures. Based on this property, we have now performed a phenotypic chemical screen in human haploid HAP1 cells aiming to identify compounds that facilitate the maintenance of haploid cells. Our top hit was 10-Deacetyl-baccatin-III (DAB), a chemical precursor in the synthesis of Taxol, which selects for haploid cells in HAP1 and mouse haploid embryonic stem cultures. Interestingly, DAB also enriches for diploid cells in mixed cultures of diploid and tetraploid cells, including in the colon cancer cell line DLD-1, revealing a general strategy for selecting cells with lower ploidy in mixed populations of mammalian cells.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31315040	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315040	cancer	2888507406903473601
172	172	35	La Radiologia medica	Clostridium difficile colitis: CT findings and differential diagnosis.	Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a severe and potentially deadly infectious colitis whose incidence is dramatically increasing in the last decades, with more virulent strains. CDI should be suspected in case of unexplained diarrhea and abdominal pain in patients with a recent history of antibiotic use and healthcare exposures; diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical and laboratory findings with demonstration of C. difficile toxins by stool test. The advantages of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) are the noninvasiveness and the ability to evaluate both the colonic wall and the adjacent soft tissues. Considerable overlap exists between the CECT findings of CDI and those of colitis of other origins, such as typhlitis, ischemic colitis, graft-versus-host disease, radiation colitis and inflammatory bowel diseases; however, some features may help distinguish between these conditions. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the imaging features of Clostridium difficile colitis and its mimics, with a view to assist the radiologist in reaching the correct diagnosis.	2019	eng	Review	Italy	31302848	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302848	Diarrhea	-9041823059579281174

She was initially misdiagnosed with sepsis of unclear source and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Empiric acyclovir was started one week into her hospitalization despite negative serologies while awaiting HSV2 PCR leading to complete resolution of symptoms. Given its high mortality and nonspecific presentation, clinicians should consider HSV hepatitis in all patients with acute hepatitis especially in high-risk population.	2019	eng	Case Reports	United States	31275672	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31275672	headache	-6941293448141178017

Inflammation plays an important role in the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), suggesting that the immune system is a target of therapeutic interventions used for treating CVDs. This study evaluated mechanisms underlying inflammatory response and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy associated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or heat shock protein 60 (HSP60)-induced Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation and the effect of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II delta B (CaMKIIδB) on these outcomes. Our results showed that treatment with HSP60 or LPS (TLR agonists) induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and complement system C3 and factor B gene expression. In vitro silencing of CaMKIIδB prevented complement gene transcription and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy associated with TLR 2/4 activation but did not prevent the increase in interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alfa gene expression in primary cultured cardiomyocytes. Moreover, CaMKIIδB silencing attenuated nuclear factor-kappa B expression. These findings supported the hypothesis that CaMKIIδB acts as a link between inflammation and cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, the present study is the first to show that extracellular HSP60 activated complement gene expression through CaMKIIδB. Our results indicated that a stress stimulus induced by LPS or HSP60 treatment promoted cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and initiated an inflammatory response through the complement system. However, CaMKIIδB silencing prevented the cardiomyocyte hypertrophy independent of inflammatory response induced by LPS or HSP60 treatment.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Brazil	31314855	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314855	stress	1852992637140705599

Deep learning (DL), a type of machine learning approach, is a powerful tool for analyzing large sets of data that are derived from biomedical sciences. However, it remains unknown whether DL is suitable for identifying contributing factors, such as biomarkers, in quantitative proteomics data. In this study, we describe an optimized DL-based analytical approach using a data set that was generated by selected reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (SRM-MS), comprising SRM-MS data from 1008 samples for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, to test its classification power. Its performance was compared with that of 5 conventional multivariate and machine learning methods: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and naïve Bayes (NB). The DL method yielded the best classification (AUC 0.9472 for the test data set) of all approaches. We also optimized the parameters of DL individually to determine which factors were the most significant. In summary, the DL method has advantages in classifying the quantitative proteomics data of pancreatic cancer patients, and our results suggest that its implementation can improve the performance of diagnostic assays in clinical settings.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31314536	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314536	cancer	-1868297195590431285

Chlorpyrifos (CPF) has become a mainly pollution in water environment. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) play an important part in the development of apoptosis and autophagy. However, the potential mechanism of CPF induced kidney toxicity and the roles of miRNAs are still unclear. To explore the underlying mechanism, the kidney of common carp exposed to different concentrations of CPF for 40 days was used as a research object. We found that CPF could damage the ultrastructure and function of kidney; and also caused antioxidant system disorder. CPF inhibited the mRNA level of miR-19a which improved AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Furthermore, the detection of apoptosis and autophagy relative genes showed that the expressions of TSC complex subunit 2 (TSC2), light chain 3 (LC3), Dynein, tumor protein 53 (p53), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), caspase-3 and caspase-9 were enhanced and the expressions of nechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), Ras homolog mTORC1 binding (Rheb) and B-cell lymphoma (Bcl-2) were reduced in dose-dependent way. Taken together, we conclude that CPF causes oxidative stress and miR-19a-AMPK axis disorder, thereby promotes apoptosis and autophagy in common carp kidney. Our study will provide theoretical basis for toxicology research and environmental protection of CPF.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31310849	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310849	stress	5274322067107287523

181	181	520	Viruses	The Clinical Perspective on Hepatitis E.	Every year, there are an estimated 20 million hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections worldwide, leading to an estimated 3.3 million symptomatic cases of hepatitis E. HEV is largely circulating in the west and is associated with several hepatic and extrahepatic diseases. HEV Genotype 1 and 2 infections are waterborne and causative for epidemics in the tropics, while genotype 3 and 4 infections are zoonotic diseases and are mainly transmitted by ingestion of undercooked pork in industrialized nations. The clinical course of these infections differs: genotype 1 and 2 infection can cause acute illness and can lead to acute liver failure (ALF) or acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) with a high mortality rate of 20% in pregnant women. In contrast, the majority of HEV GT-3 and -4 infections have a clinically asymptomatic course and only rarely lead to acute on chronic liver failure in elderly or patients with underlying liver disease. Immunosuppressed individuals infected with genotype 3 or 4 may develop chronic hepatitis E, which then can lead to life-threatening cirrhosis. Furthermore, several extra-hepatic manifestations affecting various organs have been associated with ongoing or previous HEV infections but the causal link for many of them still needs to be proven. There is no approved specific therapy for the treatment of acute or chronic HEV GT-3 or -4 infections but off-label use of ribavirin has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in the majority of patients. However, in approximately 15% of chronically HEV infected patients, cure is not possible.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31284447	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284447	Cirrhosis	8084284001249507595

Defining occupational latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) risk among healthcare workers is needed to support implementation of prevention guidelines. Prospective cohort study of 200 medical residents and nursing students in India was conducted May 2016-December 2017. Tuberculin skin test (TST) and QuantiFERON TB Gold Test-in-tube (QFT-GIT) were performed at study entry and 12 months. Primary outcome was incident LTBI (≥10mm TST induration and/or ≥0.35IU/mL QFT-GIT) at 12 months; secondary outcomes included baseline LTBI prevalence and risk factors for incident and prevalent LTBI using Poisson regression. Among 200, [90 nursing students and 110 medical residents], LTBI prevalence was 30% (95% CI, 24-37); LTBI incidence was 26.8 (95% CI, 18.6-37.2) cases per 100 person-years and differed by testing method (28.7 [95% CI, 20.6-38.9] vs 17.4 [95% CI, 11.5-25.4] cases per 100 person-years using TST and QFT-GIT, respectively). Medical residents had two-fold greater risk of incident LTBI than nursing students (Relative Risk, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.05-4.42). During study period 6 (3%) HCWs were diagnosed with active TB disease. Overall, median number of self-reported TB exposures was 5 (Interquartile Range, 1-15). Of 60 participants with prevalent and incident LTBI who were offered free isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), only 2 participants initiated and completed IPT. High risk for LTBI was noted among medical residents compared to nursing students. Self-reported TB exposure is underreported, and uptake of LTBI prevention therapy remains low. New approaches are needed to identify HCWs at highest risk for LTBI.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31283794	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31283794	tuberculosis	-1484165300616478995

A syringe services program (SSP) was established following the Indiana HIV outbreak among persons who inject drugs (PWID) in Scott County. Among Indiana-based PWID, we examined injection behaviors associated with HIV status, SSP use after its establishment, and changes in injection behaviors after the outbreak response. During 2016, we interviewed 200 PWID and assessed injection behaviors before the response by HIV status. We reported injection behaviors prior to the response and used Fisher's exact Chi square tests (P < 0.05) to assess differences by HIV status. Next, among persons who injected both before (July-December 2014) and after (past 30 days) the response, we (1) reported the proportion of persons who used the SSP to obtain sterile syringes, and assessed differences in SSP use by HIV status using Fisher's exact Chi square tests; and (2) compared distributive and receptive sharing of injection equipment and disposal of syringes before and after the outbreak response, and assessed statistical differences using McNemar's test. We also compared injection behaviors before and after the response by HIV status. Injecting extended release oxymorphone (Opana® ER); receptive sharing of syringes and cookers; and distributive sharing of cookers, filters, or water before the response were associated with HIV infection. SSP use was high (86%), particularly among HIV-positive compared with HIV-negative persons (98% vs. 84%). Injection equipment sharing decreased and safe disposal of used syringes increased after the response, especially among HIV-positive persons. Injection equipment sharing contributed to the outbreak. High SSP use following the response, particularly among HIV-positive persons, contributed to decreased high-risk injection practices.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313095	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313095	HIV	751528815916485437

The association between physical activity and lung function is thought to depend on smoking history but most previous research uses self-reported measures of physical activity. This cross-sectional study investigates whether the association between accelerometer-derived physical activity and lung function in older adults differs by smoking history. The sample comprised 3063 participants (age = 60-83 years) who wore an accelerometer during 9 days and undertook respiratory function tests. Forced vital capacity (FVC) was associated with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA; acceleration ≥0.1 g (gravity)) in smokers but not in never smokers: FVC differences for 10 min increase in MVPA were 58.6 (95% Confidence interval: 21.1, 96.1), 27.8 (4.9, 50.7), 16.6 (7.9, 25.4), 2.8 (-5.2, 10.7) ml in current, recent ex-, long-term ex-, and never-smokers, respectively. A similar trend was observed for forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Functional data analysis, a threshold-free approach using the entire accelerometry distribution, showed an association between physical activity and lung function in all smoking groups, with stronger association in current and recent ex-smokers than in long-term ex- and never-smokers; the associations were evident in never smokers only at activity levels above the conventional 0.1 g MVPA threshold. These findings suggest that the association between lung function and physical activity in older adults is more pronounced in smokers than non-smokers.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31311982	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311982	smoking	-4704033845097735448

In 2010, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology published a recommendation that annual influenza vaccination of healthcare workers be made a condition of employment despite no high-level evidence to support this recommendation. A better strategy for reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses in the healthcare setting would be to encourage vaccination and reduce presenteeism, which is very common among healthcare workers with influenza-like illness. In a hospital with a baseline vaccination compliance of 70%, reducing presenteeism by 2% has the equivalent impact of mandating vaccination in terms of the number of healthcare workers with influenza-like illness at work. Expectations for compliance with interventions to improve the quality of care should be correlated tightly to the underlying evidence to support the intervention, reserving mandates for interventions with very high quality supporting evidence.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31011587	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31011587	flu	-569322218183730892

As a novel vaccine alternative process, this spray freeze-dried (SFD) micropellet technology was evaluated using as a model a yellow fever virus produced in Vero cells (vYF). Screening of excipients was performed in order to optimize physico-chemical properties of the micropellets. Sugar/polymer-based formulations induced high glass transition temperature (Tg), adequate breaking force and attrition resistance of the SFD micropellets. These mechanical parameters and their stability are of considerable importance for the storage, the transport but also the filling process of the SFD micropellets. By adding excipients required to best preserve virus infectivity, an optimal sugar/polymer-based formulation was selected to build micropellets containing vYF. Monodisperse and dried micropellets with a diameter of about 530 µm were obtained, exhibiting similar potency to conventional freeze-dried product in terms of vYF infectious titer when both solid forms were kept under refrigerated conditions (2-8°C). Comparable kinetics of degradation were observed for vYF formulated in micropellets or as conventional freeze-dried product during an accelerated stability study using incubations at 25°C and 37°C over several weeks. The results from this investigation demonstrate the ability to formulate live-attenuated viruses in micropellets. Pharmaceutical applications of this novel vaccine solid form are discussed.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31306751	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306751	vaccine	3068975614432538771

A feeding trial was performed to compare the effects of five ethanol herbal extracts (bhumi amla, Phyllanthus amarus Schum and Thonn [Pa]; guava, Psidium guajava L. [Pg]; sensitive plant, Mimosa pudica L. [Mp]; neem, Azadirachta indica A. Juss [Ai] and asthma plant, Euphorbia hirta L. [Eh]) on the immune response and disease resistance against Edwardsiella ictaluri infection of striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus). Fish were fed diets supplemented with two doses of each plant extract (0% [basal diet], 0.4% Eh [Eh0.4], 2.0% Eh [Eh2.0], 0.2% Pa [Pa0.2], 1.0% Pa [Pa1.0], 0.2% Pg [Pg0.2], 1.0% Pg [Pg1.0], 0.4% Mp [Mp0.4], 2.0% Mp [Mp2.0], 0.4% Ai [Ai0.4], 2.0% Ai [Ai2.0]) for 8 weeks. Results showed that hematological parameters (total red blood cells, white blood cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils) of fish fed extract-based diets were significantly higher than in those fed the control diet (p < 0.05) after 4 and 8 weeks. Plasma lysozyme activity increased in fish whose diets contained both doses of Eh (p < 0.05) in week 4 (W4), whereas lysozyme activity increased in fish fed 0.2% Pa and Pg, and 2.0% Ai and Eh (p < 0.05) in week 8 (W8). The lysozyme levels in skin mucus did not significantly differ between treatments (p > 0.05) in W4 and after the bacterial challenge test. At the end of the feeding trial, levels of ACH50 significantly increased in most of extract groups compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Total immunoglobulin increased considerably in both the plasma and skin mucus of fish fed extract-supplemented diets after 8 weeks. In addition, dietary supplementation with Pg, Mp, Pa0.2, Eh2.0, and Ai0.4 for 8 weeks considerably reduced the cumulative mortality against E. ictaluri infection in striped catfish. The results suggest that plant extracts possibly modulate the striped catfish immune response in a time and dose dependent manner. Specifically, diets enriched with extracts of P. guajava at 0.2 and 1.0%, or M. pudica at 2.0% for 8 weeks, have great potential for improving striped catfish health by enhancing the immune system and reducing mortality against bacterial challenges.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31306761	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306761	asthma	-7298164314968527788
201	201	167	Wiener klinische Wochenschrift	Challenges in rehabilitation of patients with nontraumatic spinal cord dysfunction due to tumors : A narrative review.	The incidence of cancer-associated non-traumatic spinal cord dysfunction is rising due to population aging and better cancer treatment. The overall benefit of rehabilitation in specialized facilities for traumatic spinal cord dysfunction has been confirmed many times. Because of their fragility and multiple comorbidities cancer patients still face challenges to complete rehabilitation in the spinal rehabilitation facilities. In this narrative review we describe specific aspects, challenges in rehabilitation and opportunities to improve care. A literature search was performed in the PubMed database from 1 January 1978 to 30 November 2018. The focus was to find publications that discuss challenges and opportunities for rehabilitation of patients with non-traumatic spinal cord dysfunction due to a tumor. Most publications described the benefits of rehabilitation in specialized facilities. There were only few publications about survival and functional outcomes after rehabilitation for this patient population. Overall benefits including fewer complications associated with spinal cord dysfunction, less pain and depression, and better quality of life were shown. Within the past decades increasing number of publications revealed a growing interest for this group of patients. Despite major progress in cancer treatment, patients still have a limited vital prognosis and access to specialized rehabilitation units because of the concerns about the medical complexity. Patients with spinal cord tumors can benefit in areas of functionality, mood, quality of life, and survival from inpatient rehabilitation programs, in spite of the increased medical comorbidities.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Austria	31312916	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312916	cancer	2586379029487881843

We evaluated the duration of neutralizing antibodies and the status of 17DD vaccine-specific T- and B-cell memory following primary and revaccination regimens for yellow fever (YF) in Brazil. We observed progressive decline of plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) seropositivity and of the levels of effector memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as interferon-γ+CD8+ T cells, 10 years after primary vaccination. Revaccination restored PRNT seropositivity as well as the levels of effector memory CD4+, CD8+, and interferon-γ+CD8+ T cells. Moreover, secondary or multiple vaccinations guarantee long-term persistence of PRNT positivity and cell-mediated memory 10 years after booster vaccination. These findings support the relevance of booster doses to heighten the 17DD-YF-specific immune response to guarantee the long-term persistence of memory components. Secondary or multiple vaccinations improved the correlates of protection triggered by 17DD-YF primary vaccination, indicating that booster regimens are needed to achieve efficient immunity in areas with high risk for virus transmission.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31298654	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298654	vaccine	1362186507591814859

206	206	68	FEBS open bio	Characterization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) P848L, an unusual EGFR variant present in lung cancer patients, in a murine Ba/F3 model.	Lung cancer patients with mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) benefit from treatments targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, both intrinsic and acquired resistance of tumors to TKIs are common, and EGFR variants have been identified that are resistant to multiple TKIs. In the present study, we characterized selected EGFR variants previously observed in lung cancer patients and expressed in a murine bone marrow pro-B Ba/F3 cell model. Among these EGFR variants, we report that an exon 20 del/ins mutation S768insVGH is resistant to erlotinib (a first-generation TKI), but sensitive to osimertinib (a third-generation TKI). We also characterized a rare exon 21 germ-line variant, EGFR P848L, which transformed Ba/F3 cells and conferred resistance to multiple EGFR-targeting TKIs. Our analysis revealed that P848L 1) does not bind erlotinib, 2) is turned over less rapidly than L858R (a common tumor-derived EGFR mutation), 3) is not autophosphorylated at Tyr-1045 (the major docking site for Cbl proto-oncogene [c-Cbl] binding), and 4) does not bind c-Cbl. Using viability assays including 300 clinically relevant targeted compounds, we observed that Ba/F3 cells transduced with EGFR P848L, S768insVGH, or L858R have very different drug-sensitivity profiles. In particular, EGFR P848L, but not L858R or S768insVGH, was sensitive to multiple Janus kinase (JAK1/2) inhibitors. In contrast, cells driven by L858R, but not by P848L, were sensitive to multikinase MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) and ERK inhibitors including EGFR-specific TKIs. These observations suggest that continued investigation of rare TKI-resistant EGFR variants is warranted to identify optimal treatments for cancer.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31314158	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314158	cancer	-42126282997118624

Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis that was first discovered in Kenya in 1930 and is now endemic throughout multiple African countries and the Arabian Peninsula. RVF virus primarily infects domestic livestock (sheep, goats, cattle) causing high rates of neonatal mortality and abortion, with human infection resulting in a wide variety of clinical outcomes, ranging from self-limiting febrile illness to life-threatening haemorrhagic diatheses, and miscarriage in pregnant women. Since its discovery, RVF has caused many outbreaks in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula with major impacts on human and animal health. However, options for the control of RVF outbreaks are limited by the lack of licensed human vaccines or therapeutics. For this reason, RVF is prioritized by the World Health Organization for urgent research and development of countermeasures for the prevention and control of future outbreaks. In this review, we highlight the current understanding of RVF, including its epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and status of vaccine development.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31310198	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310198	vaccine	1041289933344278866
209	209	346	The American journal of cardiology	Characteristics and Outcomes of Methamphetamine Abuse Among Veterans With Heart Failure.	Methamphetamine is one of the most commonly abused illicit substances worldwide. Chronic methamphetamine abuse (MA) is associated with the development of a dilated cardiomyopathy. MA in patients with heart failure (MethHF) is increasingly reported yet poorly characterized. This was a retrospective cohort study of veterans treated at the VA Medical Center in San Diego between 2005 and 2015 with a diagnosis of HF and a history of MA. The incidence of MA each year was calculated, and clinical characteristics and outcomes of veterans with HF with and without MA were compared. Among 9,491 veterans with HF, 429 were identified as having a history of MA. Between 2006 and 2015, the incidence of MA in veterans with HF doubled from 3.44% to 6.70%. Of the 429 identified, 106 veterans had a hospitalization for HF and they were compared with veterans with HF without evidence of MA (HF). Compared with veterans with HF, veterans with MethHF were significantly younger (60.7 ± 7.3 vs 71.6 ± 11.6 years, p <0.001), with more frequent co-morbid post-traumatic stress disorder (16.8% vs 4.4%, p = 0.006), depression (28.7% vs 11.0%, p = 0.002), homelessness (27.9% vs 8.9%, p = 0.001), and unemployment (55.8% vs 30.0%, p <0.001). Despite their younger age, veterans with MethHF had high rates of HF readmission or emergency room visit (49% vs 38% in MethHF vs HF, p = 0.34) and mortality at 6 months (27% vs 38% in MethHF vs HF, p = 0.10) compared with HF. In conclusion, MA in veterans with HF is on the rise. Certain demographic and clinical characteristics of veterans with MethHF may contribute to their poor outcomes.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31311659	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311659	stress	-6817732106250460899
210	210	595	Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior	Dissociating action and abstract verb comprehension post-stroke.	The neural bases of action and abstract concept representations remain a topic of debate. While several lines of research provide evidence for grounding of action-related conceptual content into sensory-motor systems, results of traditional lesion-deficit studies have been somewhat inconsistent. Further, few studies have directly compared the neural substrates of action and relatively abstract verb comprehension post-stroke. Here, we investigated the impact of the disruption of two neural networks on comprehension of action and relatively abstract verbs in 48 unilateral left-hemisphere stroke patients using two methodologies: 1) lesion-deficit association and 2) resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analyses. Disruption of RSFC between the left inferior frontal gyrus and right hemisphere primary and secondary sensory-motor areas predicted greater relative impairment of action semantics. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping revealed that damage to frontal white matter, extending towards the inferior frontal gyrus, also predicted greater relative impairment of action semantics. On the other hand, damage to the left anterior middle temporal gyrus significantly impaired the more abstract category relative to action. These findings support the view that action and non-action/abstract semantic processing rely on partially dissociable brain networks, with action concepts relying more heavily on sensory-motor areas. The results also have wider implications for lesion-deficit association studies and show how the contralateral hemisphere can play a compensatory role following unilateral stroke.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Italy	31302507	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302507	stroke	7555106864392724379

Being mobile and able to self-care and fear of falling are important to patients. A central goal of nursing care following fragility fracture is to maximise mobility. Individual patient goals are determined by their pre-fracture mobility and functional status. Recovery is often compromised for those with limited pre-fracture activity and cognitive impairment, low functional levels postoperatively, older age, polypharmacy, comorbidities, depression, poor nutritional status, lack of social support and not living independently. Many patients never recover their previous level of function after a fragility fracture, and there is significant risk of institutionalisation, new fractures, disability and loss of independence.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314471	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314471	depression	-1287202638861144684

218	218	650	PloS one	Ambrosin, a potent NF-κβ inhibitor, ameliorates lipopolysaccharide induced memory impairment, comparison to curcumin.	Despite its poor bioavailability, curcumin is a promising natural polyphenol targeting NF-κβ. NF-κβ is a target for new therapeutics because it plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD). In contrast, ambrsoin, a sesquiterpene lactone which is a potent NF-κβ inhibitor, is scarcely studied in AD models. The current work aims to assess the efficacy of ambrosin as a possible remedy for AD. In silico studies showed that bioavailability and BBB permeability could be favorable for ambrosin over curcumin. Memory impairment was induced in mice by single intraperitoneal injection of LPS (0.4 mg/kg). Treated groups received curcumin (100 mg/kg) or ambrosin at doses (5 or 10 mg/kg) for 7 days. Mice in treated groups showed a significant improvement in memory functions during Morris water maze and object recognition tests. Curcumin and ambrosin (10 mg/kg) inhibited the upsurge of NF-κβp65 transcript and protein levels. Consequently, downstream pro-inflammatory and nitrosative mediators were inhibited, namely, TNF-α, IL-1β, COX-2 and iNOS. BACE1 was inhibited, thereby reducing amyloid plaques (Aβ) deposition and eventually reducing inflammation and apoptosis of neurons as revealed by immunohistopathological examination. In conclusion, ambrosin can be repurposed as AD remedy after further pharmacokinetic/pharamacodynamic assessments. It could serve as an additional lead drug for AD therapeutics.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31276550	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31276550	Alzheimer	179286456725721055
219	219	162	Investigational new drugs	Stimulation of neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer cells by GHRH and its blockade by GHRH antagonists.	Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in developed countries. Neuroendocrine prostate cancer, in particular, is associated with an aggressive phenotype and a poor prognosis. Neuroendocrine cells produce and secrete peptide hormones and growth factors in a paracrine/autocrine manner which promote the progression of the disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that extracellular vesicles or exosomes are released by prostate cancer cells, supporting the spread of prostate cancer. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) on neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in the androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. GHRH induced an increase in the percentage of neurite-bearing cells and in the protein levels of Neuron-Specific Enolase. Both effects were blocked by the GHRH receptor antagonist MIA-690. In addition, pretreatment of these cells with the calcium chelator BAPTA, the EGFR inhibitor AG-1478 or the HER2 inhibitor AG-825 reduced the effect of GHRH, suggesting that the GHRH-induced stimulation of NED involves calcium channel activation and EGFR/HER2 transactivation. Finally, PC3-derived exosomes led to an increase in NED, cell proliferation and cell adhesion. Altogether, these findings suggest that GHRH antagonists should be considered for in the management of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31312936	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312936	cancer	8605423472891112686

Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) is a promising biotherapeutic tool that has been used as a vaccine against both infectious diseases and cancer. saRNA has been shown to induce protein expression for up to 60 days and elicit immune responses with lower dosing than messenger RNA (mRNA). Because saRNA is a large (~9500 nt), negatively charged molecule, it requires a delivery vehicle for efficient cellular uptake and degradation protection. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for RNA formulations, where the prevailing paradigm is to encapsulate RNA within the particle, including the first FDA-approved small-interfering siRNA therapy. Here, we compared LNP formulations with cationic and ionizable lipids with saRNA either on the interior or exterior of the particle. We show that LNPs formulated with cationic lipids protect saRNA from RNAse degradation, even when it is adsorbed to the surface. Furthermore, cationic LNPs deliver saRNA equivalently to particles formulated with saRNA encapsulated in an ionizable lipid particle, both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that cationic and ionizable LNP formulations induce equivalent antibodies against HIV-1 Env gp140 as a model antigen. These studies establish formulating saRNA on the surface of cationic LNPs as an alternative to the paradigm of encapsulating RNA.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31300730	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300730	HIV	1423541364223434892

The seasonal influenza virus afflicts millions of people in the U.S. population each year, imposing significant costs on those who fall ill, their families, employers, and the health care system. The flu is transmitted via droplet spread or close contact, and certain environments, such as schools or offices, promote transmission. In this paper, we examine whether increases in employment are associated with increased incidence of the flu. We use state-level data on the prevalence of the flu from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In our preferred specification, we find that a one percentage point increase in the employment rate increases the number of influenza related outpatient health care visits by 19%, and these effects are highly pronounced in the retail sector and healthcare sector, the sectors with the highest levels of interpersonal contact.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31097347	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31097347	flu	7645026617184703521

The demand for alternative protein sources by the livestock industry has increased substantially. Therefore, insects are being promoted as a novel nutrient source in animal feed. As detailed in this review, eleven patents related to feeding insects to terrestrial animals including livestock and companion animals have been commercially applied. Six and eight of the patents have been used to produce poultry and fish, and crustacean feed, respectively. The most promising species for industrial feed production was the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens), the mealworm (Tenebrio molitor), and the two-spotted cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus). Regarding research areas of the patents reviewed here, studies on the composition and optimal mixing ratio of feeds and on insect rearing, harvesting, and post-harvest technologies were mainly performed for the industrial mass production of safe and functional animal feeds containing insects. Continuous scientific innovations and improved processing technologies will aid further advancements in this field. Therefore, this review offers insights to identify directions of future research and provides information on different insect-based feedstuffs for animals including terrestrial livestock, fish and shellfish, and companion animals, as also discussed in various patents.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United Arab Emirates	31288733	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288733	Alzheimer	5189107351987144723

With the standpoint ofref ining the chemotherapy regimen, we retrospectively reviewed adverse events encountered by the initial 10 cases during the first course of docetaxel plus ramucirumab for non-small-cell lung cancer that progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy. Febrile neutropenia(FN)was observed in 40% ofcases, and a halfofall patients experienced oral mucositis, including 2 Grade 3 cases. These results were concordant with a previous randomized phaseⅡstudy on Japanese patients. We amended the treatment regimen by adding the prophylactic use ofpegf ilgrastim. Post-amendment, FN was not observed in all 10 cases. However, the frequency and severity of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis were not affected; Therefore, some patients discontinued treatment due to this toxicity as well as diarrhea. In conclusion, prophylactic granulocyte-colony stimulating factor is considered effective for reducing the risk of FN. Further intervention by an oral care team is required to validate our findings.	2019	jpn	Journal Article	Japan	31273171	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31273171	Diarrhea	8300126456272756546

The sex ratio at birth (SRB) may be patterned by maternal condition and/or environmental stressors. However, despite decades of research, empirical results from across the social and biological sciences are equivocal on this topic. Using longitudinal individual-level data from a US population during the interwar period (1918-1939), inclusive of three distinct eras (Spanish Flu, Roaring '20 s, and the Great Depression), we evaluate predictions from two theoretical frameworks used to study patterning in SRB - (1) 'frail males' and (2) adaptive sex-biased investment theory (Trivers-Willard). The first approach centers on greater male susceptibility to exogenous stressors and argues that offspring survival should be expected to differ between 'good' and 'bad' times. The second approach contends that mothers themselves play a direct role in manipulating offspring SRB, and that those in better condition should invest more in sons. In-line with 'frail male' predictions, we find that boys are less likely to be born during the environmentally challenging times of the Spanish Flu and Great Depression. However, we find no evidence that maternal condition is associated with sex ratios at birth, a result inconsistent with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31227750	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31227750	flu	-8388400806941996172

The proportion of patients who achieved a platelet count threshold, the proportion of patients who maintained a platelet count >50,000/µl, sustained virological response (SVR) rates and safety parameters were evaluated. Of the 45 enrolled patients (median age, 59 years; median platelet count, 63,000/µl; 98% with Child-Pugh class A), 43 (96%) achieved the platelet count threshold during the pre-antiviral phase. A total of 13 patients (29%) experienced ≥1 adverse event (AE), of which headache and vomiting were the most common, and 41 patients (mostly receiving eltrombopag 12.5 mg or 25 mg) entered the antiviral phase, of which 36 (88%) maintained the platelet count threshold; no patient platelet count decreased below 25,000/µl. Nine patients (22%) achieved an SVR at the 24-week follow-up. Grade ≥3 AEs occurred in 25 patients (61%). A total of 8 serious AEs occurred in five patients (12%).

Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying allergic and nonallergic eosinophilic inflammation have evolved tremendously in the last 2 decades, but the cause of this inflammation in any individual is often uncertain. Inhaled corticosteroids are the mainstay therapy for cough due to asthma or nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, and response is related to the presence of biomarkers of eosinophilic airway inflammation. In upper airway cough syndrome, nasal topical corticosteroids are beneficial in allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with polyposis.

Behavioral modification (BM) is a strategy designed to sustain or restore well-being through effects such as enhanced relaxation, reduced stress, and improved sleep. Few studies have explored the role of BM delivered in the context of fitness programs for healthy adults. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to examine whether BM combined with aerobic and resistance training programs would improve health and fitness measures more than the exercise training alone. Thirty-two healthy fitness club members (19 men) were randomized to receive a BM program (n=15) or an equal-attention (EA) control (n=17). BM consisted of twelve, 10-min education sessions between a trained fitness professional and the participant, coupled with weekly, individualized relaxation, stress reduction, and sleep improvement assignments. All participants engaged in 1 h of coached resistance training and remotely guided aerobic exercise thrice weekly for 12 weeks. Fitness measures (aerobic performance, body composition, muscle strength and endurance, lower-body power), sleep characteristics, and heart rate variability (HRV) were obtained at baseline and after the 12-week program. BM resulted in greater improvements in aerobic performance (increased maximum oxygen uptake, metabolic (lactate) threshold, and percent of maximum oxygen uptake at which metabolic threshold occurred), peak and average lower-body power, and body composition (decreased body fat percentage and fat mass) compared to EA. BM also positively influenced parasympathetic tone through increased High-frequency HRV. BM resulted in greater improvements in fitness measures, body composition, and heart rate variability compared with EA. These findings have intriguing implications regarding the role of BM in augmenting health and physical performance.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31312715	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312715	stress	-3515692979189178102

Due to the prevalence of depression during childbearing, mothers may be prescribed multiple antidepressants, yet little is known about the risk and consequences to the offspring or to the subsequent generations. Fluoxetine (FLX) is usually the first line of pharmacological treatment for affective disorders in pregnant women, and venlafaxine (VEN) may be used as a secondary treatment. Given that FLX and VEN readily cross the placenta, a fetus from a treated pregnant woman is potentially at risk from the endocrine disruptive effects of these chemicals. Pharmaceuticals including FLX and VEN reach aquatic ecosystems through sewage release, so fish may be inadvertently affected. Here, we report that a 6-day FLX exposure during early zebrafish development to an environmentally relevant (0.54 µg·L-1 in water) and a concentration detected in the cord blood of FLX-treated pregnant women (54 µg·L-1 in water) reduces the stress response (the arithmetic difference between the stress-induced and unstressed whole-body cortisol levels) in the adult females and males, an effect that persists for four generations. To model the possibility of a second antidepressant exposure, the filial generation 4 (F4), was exposed to VEN (5 µg·L-1). We found that FLX exposure sensitizes these descendants to VEN. The VEN treatment further suppresses cortisol production in females and decreases spawning rates in adult pairs. This is an important demonstration that in an animal model, a brief ancestral exposure of great-great-grandparents to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor FLX shapes the physiological responses of future generations to the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor VEN.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31305910	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305910	depression	5311977399951270341
242	242	289	Scientific reports	Soluble Wood Smoke Extract Promotes Barrier Dysfunction in Alveolar Epithelial Cells through a MAPK Signaling Pathway.	Wildfire smoke induces acute pulmonary distress and is of particular concern to risk groups such as the sick and elderly. Wood smoke (WS) contains many of the same toxic compounds as those found in cigarette smoke (CS) including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and free radicals. CS is a well-established risk factor for respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD. Limited studies investigating the biological effects of WS on the airway epithelium have been performed. Using a cell culture-based model, we assessed the effects of a WS-infused solution on alveolar epithelial barrier function, cell migration, and survival. The average geometric mean of particles in the WS was 178 nm. GC/MS analysis of the WS solution identified phenolic and cellulosic compounds. WS exposure resulted in a significant reduction in barrier function, which peaked after 24 hours of continuous exposure. The junctional protein E-cadherin showed a prominent reduction in response to increasing concentrations of WS. Furthermore, WS significantly repressed cell migration following injury to the cell monolayer. There was no difference in cell viability following WS exposure. Mechanistically, WS exposure induced activation of the p44/42, but not p38, MAPK signaling pathway, and inhibition of p44/42 phosphorylation prevented the disruption of barrier function and loss of E-cadherin staining. Thus, WS may contribute to the breakdown of alveolar structure and function through a p44/42 MAPK-dependent pathway and may lead to the development and/or exacerbation of respiratory pathologies with chronic exposure.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31296909	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296909	asthma	2333823948799779498

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a common benign finding in healthy subjects, but its prevalence is higher in patients with stroke of unclear cause (cryptogenic stroke). PFO is believed to be associated with stroke through paradoxical embolism, and certain clinical and anatomical criteria seem to increase the likelihood of a PFO to be pathological. Recent trials have shown that closure of PFO, especially if associated with an atrial septal aneurysm and/or a large interatrial shunt, may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke as compared to medical treatment. However, it remains challenging to risk stratify patients with suspected PFO-related stroke and to decide if device closure is indicated. We sought to review contemporary evidence and to conclude an evidence-based strategy to prevent recurrence of PFO-related stroke.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31307049	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307049	stroke	-3785072380450959101

Hypoglycemia is a key barrier to optimum glycemic control in insulin treated diabetes patients. A national level expert group meeting was held at the 11th national insulin summit to analyze published data from clinical studies and guidelines to evolve consensus recommendations on identification and management of hypoglycemia in insulin-treated diabetes patients. This consensus statement emphasizes consideration of suggestive symptoms or blood glucose levels ≤70 mg/dl and ability to self-treat in identification and classification of hypoglycemia. Patient questionnaire administration at each patient visit will enable accurate reporting of hypoglycemia. Patients with strict glycemic control, high glycemic variability, history of severe hypoglycemia, impaired hypoglycemia awareness, long duration of disease or insulin therapy could be at an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Prevention of hypoglycemia should include monitoring and goal setting, patient education, dietary intervention, exercise counseling and medication adjustment. Basal insulin analogues (vs. NPH), rapid-acting insulin analogues (vs. RHI) and premix insulin analogues (vs. BHI) are more appropriate options with superiority of insulin degludec to insulin glargine U100 and IDegAsp to BIAsp 30 to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

Congenital Sodium Diarrhea (CSD) due to SLC9A3 mutation is a rare cause of neonatal diarrhea explained by dysfunction of the Na+/H+ antiporter 3 in intestine. To date only 10 patients have been described. We report a male patient with typical antenatal symptoms (polyhydramnios and intestinal dilation) and neonatal diarrhea with fecal sodium and bicarbonates loss. Next generation sequencing revealed a missense homozygous mutation in exon 6 of the SLC9A3 gene (NM_004174.3:c.1039G > A, NP_004165.2:p.Glu347Lys). Oral electrolytes supplements (Sodium and Bicarbonates) allowed a normal growth to the child currently aged twenty months. CSD symptomatology usually begins during third trimester of pregnancy. Antenatal signs are polyhydramnios and diffuse intestinal dilation. Main differential diagnoses are intestinal obstruction and Congenital Chloride Diarrhea. Diarrhea begins from the first days of life and its severity is variable. Based on the report and on the literature we suggest that non syndromic CSD can be detected during third trimester of pregnancy.

261	261	210	Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene	Do HCWs adequately know about meningitis and 4CMenB vaccine and recommend its use to parents? A cross sectional analysis in Campania Region, Italy.	Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is a severe disease caused by various Neisseria meningitidis serogroups that represents a serious public health problem worldwide. In Italy, serogroups B and C are the major causes of IMD. On 14 January 2013, the European Medicines Agency authorized the use of the first vaccine available to protect against meningococcal serogroup B (4CMenB). The aim of this study was to assess the IMD epidemiology knowledge and 4CMenB vaccine attitudes of healthcare workers (HCWs) with regard to recommending this vaccine for use, vaccine practices and infectious disease control in the Campania region in Italy. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 293 HCWs (49.5% physicians and 46.4% nurses)interviewed using a self-administered questionnaire. The majority of the HCWs had sufficient knowledge about the disease incidence and lethality, but they were less informed about the higher risk age categories and the serogroups most frequently involved. Additionally, their knowledge about the vaccine was poor with regard to the targeted categories and side effects. Approximately30.0% of the HCWs reported incidences of fever and pain and swelling at the injection site. Moreover,32.8% of the HCWs knew that the risk of developing adverse reactions increases when the 4CMenB vaccine is co-administered with other vaccines. Overall, all of the HCWs were convinced that vaccinations are an important instrument for preventing infectious diseases, and they were aware of their central role in promoting the 4CmenB vaccination and their need to be better informed.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Italy	31312744	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312744	vaccine	-1911407455198985777

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia. Hallmarks of AD are memory impairments and cognitive deficits, but non-cognitive impairments, especially motor dysfunctions are also associated with the disease and may even precede classic clinical symptoms. With an aging society and increasing hospitalization of the elderly, motor deficits are of major interest to improve independent activities in daily living. Consistent with clinical findings, a variety of AD mouse models develop motor deficits as well. We investigated the motor function of 3- and 7-month-old Tg4-42 mice in comparison to wild-type controls and 5XFAD mice and discuss the results in context with several other AD mouse model. Our study shows impaired balance and motor coordination in aged Tg4-42 mice in the balance beam and rotarod test, while general locomotor activity and muscle strength is not impaired at 7 months. The cerebellum is a major player in the regulation and coordination of balance and locomotion through practice. Particularly, the rotarod test is able to detect cerebellar deficits.

The diverse secondary metabolites play an important role in the prevention and cure of various diseases including neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Naturally occurring compounds such as flavonoids, polyphenols, alkaloids, and glycosides found in various parts of the plant and/or marine sources may potentially protect neurodegeneration as well as improve memory and cognitive function. Many natural compounds show anti-Alzheimer activity through specific pharmacological mechanisms like targeting β-amyloid, Beta-secretase 1 and Acetylcholinesterase.

Older adults are slower at recognizing visual objects than younger adults. The same is true for recognizing that a letter string is a real word. People with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) demonstrate even longer responses in written word recognition than elderly controls. Despite the general tendency towards slower recognition in aging and neurocognitive disorders, certain characteristics of words influence word recognition speed regardless of age or neuropathology (e.g., a word's frequency of use). We present here a protocol for examining the influence of lexical characteristics on word recognition response times in a simple lexical decision experiment administered to younger and older adults and people with MCI or AD. In this experiment, participants are asked to decide as quickly and accurately as possible whether a given letter string is an actual word or not. We also describe mixed-effects models and principal components analysis that can be used to detect the influence of different types of lexical variables or individual characteristics of participants on word recognition speed.	2019	eng	Video-Audio Media	United States	31305521	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305521	aging	-3920124114454832425

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare disorder of the renal collecting tubules, characterized by an inability to concentrate urine due to an impaired response to arginine vasopressin (AVP), resulting in dilute urine and polyuria. Causes of NDI are heterogeneous and diagnosing congenital NDI (cNDI) in young infants is clinically challenging, as typical symptoms are often unappreciated or inconspicuous. Instead, young infants may present with non-specific signs such as vomiting, poor feeding, failure to thrive, unexplained fevers, irritability, constipation or diarrhea. We report a 37-day-old infant who presented with polyuria and severe hypernatremic dehydration that was unresponsive to vasopressin. The patient was treated with amiloride, indomethacin and hydrochlorothiazide. Genetic analysis revealed a novel contiguous deletion involving the entire AVPR2 gene and the last exon of the adjacent ARHGAP4 gene. A study of the family confirmed the carrier status in the mother. This case illustrates the importance of molecular testing in confirming the diagnosis in the index patient, as well as in identifying asymptomatic at-risk female carriers so that appropriate genetic counselling can be given for reproductive planning. All pediatric patients with suspected cNDI should undergo genetic analysis for a definitive diagnosis.	2019	eng	Case Reports	Germany	31271558	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271558	Diarrhea	719128783277038733
278	278	89	PloS one	Two tales: Worldwide distribution of Central Asian (CAS) versus ancestral East-African Indian (EAI) lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis underlines a remarkable cleavage for phylogeographical, epidemiological and demographical characteristics.	The East African Indian (EAI) and Central Asian (CAS) lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) mainly infect tuberculosis (TB) patients in the eastern hemisphere which contains many of the 22 high TB burden countries including China and India. We investigated if phylogeographical, epidemiological and demographical characteristics for these 2 lineages differed in SITVIT2 database. Genotyping results and associated data (age, sex, HIV serology, drug resistance) on EAI and CAS lineages (n = 10,974 strains) were extracted. Phylogenetic and Bayesian, and other statistical analyses were used to compare isolates. The male/female sex ratio was 907/433 (2.09) for the EAI group vs. 881/544 (1.62) for CAS (p-value<0.002). The proportion of younger patients aged 0-20 yrs. with CAS lineage was significantly higher than for EAI lineage (18.07% vs. 10.85%, p-value<0.0001). The proportion of multidrug resistant and extensively drug resistant TB among CAS group (30.63% and 1.03%, respectively) was significantly higher than in the EAI group (12.14% and 0.29%, respectively; p-value<0.0001). Lastly, the proportion of HIV+ patients was 20.34% among the EAI group vs. 3.46% in the CAS group (p-value<0.0001). This remarkable split observed between various parameters for these 2 lineages was further corroborated by their geographic distribution profile (EAI being predominantly found in Eastern-Coast of Africa, South-India and Southeast Asia, while CAS was predominantly found in Afghanistan, Pakistan, North India, Nepal, Middle-east, Libya, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania). Some geo-specificities were highlighted. This study demonstrated a remarkable cleavage for aforementioned characteristics of EAI and CAS lineages, showing a North-South divide along the tropic of cancer in Eastern hemisphere-mainly in Asia, and partly prolonged along the horn of Africa. Such studies would be helpful to better comprehend prevailing TB epidemic in context of its historical spread and evolutionary features, and provide clues to better treatment and patient-care in countries and regions concerned by these lineages.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31299060	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299060	tuberculosis	-973131232603202326

Cerebral edema (CE) is a rare but potentially fatal complication of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children with type 1 diabetes. CE is frequently mentioned as being more common in young children. The primary objective of this study was to review the evidence suggesting that younger age is a risk factor for the development of CE during DKA. The secondary objective was to assess if younger children are at a higher risk of DKA and severe DKA. A literature review was performed, and studies which reported the frequency of CE, DKA and severe DKA in children <3 and 3 to 5 years of age were included. Among the 6 studies reporting the frequency of CE that were identified, 5 good-quality studies found no significant association between younger age and higher risk of CE. Twenty-seven studies (DKA frequency: 11.3% to 54%) reported DKA frequency as a function of age. Most published studies found a higher frequency of DKA in children <5 years of age (20/25 studies), and in particular in those in the first 2 to 3 years of life (8/8 studies). There was inconclusive evidence to determine whether the severity of DKA was influenced by age. In conclusion, the commonly held view that CE is more common in younger children is not supported by the existing literature. Published data suggest that DKA (and possibly severe DKA) is more common in very young children. Regardless of age, all children with DKA should be monitored carefully for the development of CE.	2019	eng	Review	Canada	31311730	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311730	diabetes	7323176445666562417

Clinical use of the antipsychotic drug olanzapine (OLA) is associated with metabolic side effects to variable degrees. N-desmethyl-olanzapine (DMO) is one major metabolite of OLA, but its potential involvement in the metabolic responses remains unclear. Here we examined whether DMO can directly impact the metabolic, endocrinal and inflammatory parameters under conditions of metabolic disturbance. DMO administration (2 mg/kg, i.g.) to high-fat diet induced obesity mice for 4 weeks induced a remarkable loss of body weight and fat mass. DMO improved insulin resistance and energy expenditure in mice, but had no significant effects on dyslipidemia or hepatic steatosis. Moreover, DMO induced morphological changes in the white adipose tissue, accompanied by reduced interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production and increased UCP1 expression. These findings demonstrate that DMO is devoid of the metabolic side effects commonly observed for OLA during obesity, which suggests that the N-desmethyl metabolism may function to regulate the metabolic responses to OLA.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31302499	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302499	obesity	-1804728901674946596

288	288	380	The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics	Effect of Pregnancy on paroxetine-induced adiposity and glucose intolerance in mice.	Long term use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) targeting the serotonin transporter (SERT) has been suggested to be associated with an increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Previously, using a murine knockout model of SERT, we showed that estrogen suppression is involved in SERT deficiency-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in non-pregnant mice. The present study investigated the effects of chronic paroxetine treatment on adiposity and glucose tolerance in mice before and during pregnancy. Chronic paroxetine treatment in non-pregnant mice resulted in visceral adiposity and glucose intolerance accompanied by reduced circulating 17β-estradiol levels and ovarian expression of the aromatase (Cyp19a1). Remarkably, pregnancy significantly reduced adiposity and improved glucose tolerance in paroxetine-treated mice by rebooting ovarian Cyp19a1 expression and 17β-estradiol production. These effects appear to be reversible as ovarian Cyp19a1 expression and circulating 17β-estradiol returned to pre-pregnancy levels soon following parturition. Similar to pregnant mice, 17β-estradiol replacement treatment in non-pregnant mice reduced paroxetine-induced adiposity. Our findings further suggested that modulation of estrogen synthesis underlies the observed metabolic adverse effects of SSRIs. Although our data revealed a transit reversal effect of pregnancy on SSRI-induced metabolic abnormalities, these observations are experimental and limited to mice. The use of SSRIs during human pregnancy should be cautioned due to potential adverse effects to the fetuses.

290	290	291	Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports	Detection of carrier state and genetic diversity of Theileria parva in ECF-vaccinated and naturally exposed cattle in Tanzania.	Infection and Treatment Method (ITM) has been practiced in Tanzania for over 20 years as a prevention measure against East Coast Fever disease. It is known that ITM, like natural ECF infection, leads to a carrier state, whereby vaccinated cattle become asymptomatic carriers of the parasite. It is expected that ECF vaccination using ITM also leads to generation of combinations of vaccine specific Theileria parva and local strains that circulate in the field what contributes to an unknown level of parasite diversity. Moreover, the long term impact of ITM on carrier state and parasite diversity in cattle are largely unknown. To address this question blood was collected from ECF-vaccinated (n = 239) and unvaccinated (n = 97) cattle from Loiborsoit, Emboreet, Esilalei, Manyara ranch and Mswakini villages in the Maasai steppe of northern Tanzania, as well as Mruazi and Leila farms in Tanga in eastern Tanzania. Screening for T. parva using nested PCR revealed an overall prevalence of T. parva to be 34.5%, with a significant higher prevalence among ECF-vaccinated cattle. Using three VNTR markers (ms2, ms5 and MS7) higher parasite genetic diversity in terms of higher number of alleles and expected heterozygosity was shown in vaccinated than unvaccinated cattle. These parameters were highest in cattle from Manyara ranch. Nevertheless, the principle component analysis (PCoA) showed no distinct clustering patterns as most T. parva alleles clustered together throughout the four quadrants implying parasite homogeneity among the sampled populations. However, some of the parasite alleles closely clustered with Muguga vaccine alleles in two of the quadrants, consistent with closer genetic relatedness between the vaccine strains and the T. parva populations from the Maasai steppe. Likewise analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed most of the genetic variation (93%) being contained within populations with only 7% being among populations. This study therefore confirms the role of ECF vaccination in enhancing carrier state and T. parva diversity in vaccinated cattle populations. Higher T. parva diversity may play an important role in carrier cattle by way of restricting breakthrough infections from field parasite strains.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31303233	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303233	vaccine	-1257839697539084047

"Nasal polyposis (NP) is characterized by polypoid outgrowths of chronically inflamed respiratory mucosa. The presence of squamous metaplasia and dysplasia on the mucosal surface of nasal polyps (NPs) represents different manifestations of epithelial atypia. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the presence of epithelial squamous metaplasia and dysplasia in ethmoidal NPs. This retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data involved 212 patients with NP undergoing endoscopic ethmoidectomy. To evaluate possible etiological factors for epithelial atypia, the patients in whom we histopathologically detected the presence of epithelial atypia were compared with patients with ""normal"" NPs in accordance with the following characteristics as found in the patients' medical records: gender, age, main symptoms, preoperative extent of sinus disease on computed tomography, atopic status, aspirin sensitivity, cigarette smoking, and occupational exposure to different noxious factors. Epithelial atypia were detected histopathologically in 44 (20.7%) NP patients, whereas features of ""true"" dysplasia were found in only 1 (0.5%) patient.

The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu mediates the downregulation of several host cell proteins, an activity that is critical for viral replication in vivo. As the first step in directing cell-surface proteins to internal cellular compartments, and in many cases degradation, Vpu binds a subset of its target proteins through their transmembrane domains. Each of the known targets of Vpu are synthesized in the ER, and must traverse the different membrane environments found along the secretory pathway, thus it is important to consider how membrane composition might influence the interactions between Vpu and its targets. We have used Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to measure the oligomerization of Vpu with the transmembrane domains of target proteins in model membranes of varying lipid composition. Our data show that both lipid bilayer thickness and acyl chain order can significantly influence monomer-oligomer equilibria within the Vpu-target system. Changes in oligomerization levels were found to be non-specific with no single Vpu-target interaction being favored under any condition. Our analysis of the influence of the membrane environment on the strength of helix-helix interactions between Vpu and its targets in vitro suggests that the strength of Vpu-target interactions in vivo will be partially dependent on the membrane environment found in specific membrane compartments.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31302078	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302078	HIV	657779080033041603

297	297	117	PloS one	Twitter-based measures of neighborhood sentiment as predictors of residential population health.	Several studies have recently applied sentiment-based lexicons to Twitter to gauge local sentiment to understand health behaviors and outcomes for local areas. While this research has demonstrated the vast potential of this approach, lingering questions remain regarding the validity of Twitter mining and surveillance in local health research. First, how well does this approach predict health outcomes at very local scales, such as neighborhoods? Second, how robust are the findings garnered from sentiment signals when accounting for spatial effects? To evaluate these questions, we link 2,076,025 tweets from 66,219 distinct users in the city of San Diego over the period of 2014-12-06 to 2017-05-24 to the 500 Cities Project data and 2010-2014 American Community Survey data. We determine how well sentiment predicts self-rated mental health, sleep quality, and heart disease at a census tract level, controlling for neighborhood characteristics and spatial autocorrelation. We find that sentiment is related to some outcomes on its own, but these relationships are not present when controlling for other neighborhood factors. Evaluating our encoding strategy more closely, we discuss the limitations of existing measures of neighborhood sentiment, calling for more attention to how race/ethnicity and socio-economic status play into inferences drawn from such measures.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31295294	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295294	heart+disease	-9092333155845304874

Old livers are more damaged by hepatic ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury than young livers. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ischemic and rapamycin preconditioning on IR injury in old livers. Young (8-week-old) and aged (60-week-old) mice were subjected to IR or a sham control procedure. The aged mice were randomly divided into six groups: IR (CON), IR with ischemic preconditioning (IPC), IR with rapamycin preconditioning (RAPA), IR with combined ischemic and rapamycin preconditioning (IPC + RAPA), IR with 3-methyladenine (3-MA), IR with combined ischemic and rapamycin preconditioning with 3-MA pretreatment (IPC + RAPA+3-MA). Liver injury was evaluated 6 h after reperfusion. Hepatocellular autophagy induction was also analyzed by western blotting. The results revealed that aged mice had aggravated liver IR injury as compared to young mice. In aged mice following IR, IPC + RAPA but not IPC or RAPA alleviated liver injury, as evidenced by lower levels of serum ALT, improved preservation of liver architecture with lower Suzuki scores, and decreased caspase-3 activity compared with CON. In addition, western blot analysis revealed increased LC3B II but decreased p62 protein expression levels in the IPC + RAPA group, indicating that autophagic flux was restored by combined ischemic and rapamycin preconditioning. Furthermore, autophagy inhibition by the inhibitor 3-MA abrogated the protective role in the IPC + RAPA group, while no significant effects were observed in the CON group. In conclusions, our results demonstrated that combined ischemic and rapamycin preconditioning protected old livers against IR injury, which was likely attributed to restored autophagy activation.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31302450	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302450	aging	2546734694784514225
306	306	468	Journal of the American Heart Association	Association Between Long-Term Exposure to Wind Turbine Noise and the Risk of Stroke: Data From the Danish Nurse Cohort.	Background Epidemiological studies suggest that road traffic noise increases the risk of stroke. Similar effects may be expected from wind turbine noise (WTN) exposure, but epidemiological evidence is lacking. The present study investigated the association between long-term exposure to WTN and the risk for stroke. Methods and Results First-ever stroke in 28 731 female nurses in the Danish Nurse Cohort was identified in the Danish National Patient register until the end of 2013. WTN, traffic noise, and air pollution exposures were estimated for all historic and present residential addresses between 1982 and 2013. Time-varying Cox proportional hazard regression was used to examine the associations between the 11-, 5-, and 1-year rolling means of WTN levels and stroke incidence. Of 23 912 nurses free of stroke at the cohort baseline, 1097 nurses developed stroke by the end of follow-up. At the cohort baseline, 10.3% of nurses were exposed to WTN (≥1 turbine within a 6000-meter radius of the residence) and 13.3% in 2013. Mean baseline residential noise levels among exposed nurses were 26.3 dB(A). No association between long-term WTN exposure and stroke incidence was found. The adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CIs for the 11-, 5-, and 1-year running mean residential WTN exposures preceding stroke diagnosis, comparing nurses with residential WTN levels above and below 20 dB(A) were 1.09 (0.90-1.31), 1.08 (0.89-1.31) and 1.08 (0.89-1.32), respectively. Conclusions This comprehensive cohort study lends no support to an association between long-term WTN exposure and stroke risk.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31310571	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310571	stroke	2695065703077082407
307	307	45	DNA repair	Roles of OGG1 in transcriptional regulation and maintenance of metabolic homeostasis.	Cellular damage produced by conditions generating oxidative stress have far-reaching implications in human disease that encompass, but are not restricted to aging, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, airway inflammation/asthma, cancer, and metabolic syndrome including visceral obesity, insulin resistance, fatty liver disease, and dyslipidemia. Although there are numerous sources and cellular targets of oxidative stress, this review will highlight literature that has investigated downstream consequences of oxidatively-induced DNA damage in both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. The presence of such damage can in turn, directly and indirectly modulate cellular transcriptional and repair responses to such stressors. As such, the persistence of base damage can serve as a key regulator in coordinated gene-response cascades. Conversely, repair of these DNA lesions serves as both a suppressor of mutagenesis and by inference carcinogenesis, and as a signal for the cessation of ongoing oxidative stress. A key enzyme in all these processes is 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), which, via non-catalytic binding to oxidatively-induced DNA damage in promoter regions, serves as a nucleation site around which changes in large-scale regulation of inflammation-associated gene expression can occur. Further, the catalytic function of OGG1 can alter the three-dimensional structure of specialized DNA sequences, leading to changes in transcriptional profiles. This review will concentrate on adverse deleterious health effects that are associated with both the diminution of OGG1 activity via population-specific polymorphic variants and the complete loss of OGG1 in murine models. This mouse model displays diet- and age-related induction of metabolic syndrome, highlighting a key role for OGG1 in protecting against these phenotypes. Conversely, recent investigations using murine models having enhanced global expression of a mitochondrial-targeted OGG1 demonstrate that they are highly resistant to diet-induced disease. These data suggest strategies through which therapeutic interventions could be designed for reducing or limiting adverse human health consequences to these ubiquitous stressors.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31311771	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311771	aging	2296515698565489277

The chicken embryo origin (CEO) infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) live attenuated vaccines, although capable of protecting against disease and reducing challenge virus replication can regain virulence. Recombinant ILT vaccines do not regain virulence but are partially successful at blocking challenge virus replication. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of rHVT-LT vaccination in CEO replication and how this vaccination strategy enhances protection and limit challenge virus transmission to contact naive chickens. The rHVT-LT vaccine was administered at 1 day of age subcutaneously and the CEO vaccine was administered at 6 weeks of age via eye-drop or drinking water. CEO vaccine replication post vaccination, challenge virus replication and transmission post-challenge were evaluated. After vaccination, only the group that received the CEO via eye-drop developed transient conjunctivitis. A significant decrease in CEO replication was detected for the rHVT-LT + CEO groups as compared to groups that received CEO alone. After challenge, reduction in clinical signs and challenge virus replication was observed in all vaccinated groups. However, among the vaccinated groups, the rHVT-LT group presented higher clinical signs and challenge virus replication. Transmission of the challenge virus to contact naive chickens was only observed in the rHVT-LT vaccinated group of chickens. Overall this study found that priming with rHVT-LT reduced CEO virus replication and the addition of a CEO vaccination provided a more robust protection than rHVT alone. Therefore, rHVT-LT + CEO vaccination strategy constitutes an alternative approach to gain better control of the disease.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31304770	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304770	vaccine	-1418355038507506357

314	314	24	EClinicalMedicine	Therapeutic Vaccination Refocuses T-cell Responses Towards Conserved Regions of HIV-1 in Early Treated Individuals (BCN 01 study).	Evidence Before this Study: T cells play an important role in the control of HIV infection and may be particularly useful for HIV-1 cure by killing cells with reactivated HIV-1. Evidence is emerging that not all T-cell responses are protective and mainly only those targeting conserved regions of HIV-1 proteins are effective, but typically immunologically subdominant, while those recognizing hypervariable, easy-to-escape immunodominant 'decoys' do not control viremia and do not protect from a loss of CD4 T cells. We pioneered a vaccine strategy focusing T-cell responses on the most conserved regions of the HIV-1 proteome using an immunogen designated HIVconsv. T cells elicited by the HIVconsv vaccines in HIV-uninfected UK and Kenyan adults inhibited in vitro replication of HIV-1 isolates from 4 major global clades A, B, C and D.Added Value of this Study: The present study demonstrated the concept that epitopes subdominant in natural infection, when taken out of the context of the whole HIV-1 proteome and presented to the immune system by a potent simian adenovirus prime-poxvirus MVA boost regimen, can induce strong responses in patients on antiretroviral treatment and efficiently refocus HIV-1-specific T-cells to the protective epitopes delivered by the vaccine.Implications of all the Available Evidence: Nearly all HIV-1 vaccine strategies currently emphasize induction of broadly neutralizing Abs. The HIVconsv vaccine is one of a very few approaches focussing exclusively on elicitation of T cells and, therefore, can complement antibody induction for better prevention and cure. Given the cross-clade reach on the HIVconsv immunogen design, if efficient, the HIVconsv vaccines could be deployed globally. Effective vaccines will likely be a necessary component in combination with other available preventive measures for halting the HIV-1/AIDS epidemic.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31312806	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312806	HIV	-2649418407515952078

Wilfley, Hayes, Balantekin, Van Buren, and Epstein (2018) provided an important review of behavioral interventions for obesity in children and adults. Although behavioral change interventions are effective in increasing the frequency of exercise behaviors, behavioral treatment providers may not be experts regarding how fundamental movement/motor skills (FMS) deficits (e.g., ability to run, skip, balance, leap, kick, throw, catch, bounce) may hinder obese children from achieving physical activity goals. Prerequisite knowledge and skills are necessary to perform new target behaviors such as increasing physical activity, and exercise physiologists are best positioned to provide individualized exercise prescriptions to improve movement competence. Similar to psychologists and other behavioral treatment providers, exercise physiologists conduct their exercise interventions using an individualized, skills-building approach; by working collaboratively, behavioral health providers and exercise physiologists can develop integrative behavioral treatment plans to improve skills (both cognitive-behavioral and FMS) that may increase physical activity and improve health outcomes in children with obesity.

Embryoid bodies (EBs) are three dimensional aggregates of pluripotent stem cells primarily used to investigate morphogenesis and cell toxicity, are also attractive tools in regenerative medicine. While embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent cells (IPSCs) have been shown to form EBs in mouse, primate and humans, EB formation have not been previously demonstrated in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Here we show that rat MSCs form EBs; which express regulatory T cell (Treg) marker Foxp3 and CC chemokine CCL1 receptor CCR8. We show a novel method for formation of EBs from MSCs under stress and demonstrate that the induction of FoxP3+ CCR8+ EBs is dependent upon CCL1 gradients which mediate cell proliferation, migration and invasion of mTregs. The identification of EBs and novel FoxP3+ CCR8+ regulatory T cells (mTregs) for selective conversion and isolation of bone marrow derived MSCs offers novel avenues for research, diagnosis and treatment.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31314754	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314754	stress	2927476152522512441

"The National Cancer Institute established a dissemination and implementation accelerator program called Speeding Research-tested INTerventions (SPRINT) in order to expedite the translation of behavioral research into practice. The goal of SPRINT is to introduce researchers to a new method for moving their research into practice in order to increase the real-world impact of their evidence-based interventions. The goal of this article is to present case studies on three teams that have completed the SPRINT program to date. Each case study provides a description of the intervention the team came into the program with, the team's motivation for participating in the SPRINT program, the team's experience in the program, lessons learned from ""customer discovery"" interviews conducted by the team during the course, and the team's future plans for their intervention. The case studies suggest that by focusing on behavioral researchers, SPRINT addresses an unmet need in the commercialization training space; that the definition of ""success"" can vary across SPRINT projects; that identifying and engaging ""payors"" for behavioral interventions is an ongoing challenge; and that there are potential ""misalignments"" between the research process and market demands. Overall, these examples show that customer discovery is a potentially useful method for making interventions more responsive to the needs of stakeholders, and that researchers can benefit from learning the ""language"" of business and working with individuals who have business experience before trying to move their research from the lab to the real world."	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31313817	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313817	cancer	3425144896890592760

These lesions are detected best by CT colonography, a powerful noninvasive test to evaluate the intraluminal aspect of the entire colon, both for colorectal cancer screening and incomplete colonoscopy. The heterogeneous group of inflammatory colonic diseases includes acute diverticular disease, colonic involvement in chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and colonic infectious and noninfectious colitis. Because of the risk of perforation, these conditions are evaluated with standard cross-sectional imaging techniques. This contribution summarizes benign conditions of the colon and rectum that can be detected during CTC and routine cross-sectional imaging techniques.

Recently reported HIV-1 capsid (CA) inhibitors GS-CA1 and GS-6207 (an analog of GS-CA1) are first-in-class compounds with long-acting potential. Reportedly, both compounds have greater potency than currently approved anti-HIV drugs. Due to the limited access to experimental data and the compounds themselves, a detailed mechanism of their inhibition is yet to be delineated. Using crystal structures of capsid-hexamers bound to well-studied capsid inhibitor PF74 and molecular modeling, we predict that GS-CA compounds bind in the pocket that is shared by previously reported CA inhibitors and host factors. Additionally, comparative modeling suggests that GS-CA compounds have unique structural features contributing to interactions with capsid. To test their proposed binding mode, we also report the design of a cyclic peptide combining structural units from GS-CA compounds, host factors, and previously reported capsid inhibitors. This peptide (Pep-1) binds CA-hexamer with a docking score comparable to GS-CA compounds. Affinity determination by MicroScale thermophoresis (MST) assays showed that CA binds Pep-1 with a ~7-fold better affinity than well-studied capsid inhibitor PF74, suggesting that it can be developed as a possible CA inhibitor.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31312185	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312185	HIV	-2041630887686751489

Redox-active, strongly magnetic, combustion and friction-derived nanoparticles (CFDNPs) are abundant in particulate matter air pollution. Urban children and young adults with Alzheimer disease Continuum have higher numbers of brain CFDNPs versus clean air controls. CFDNPs surface charge, dynamic magnetic susceptibility, iron content and redox activity contribute to ROS generation, neurovascular unit (NVU), mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) damage, and are catalysts for protein misfolding, aggregation and fibrillation. CFDNPs respond to external magnetic fields and are involved in cell damage by agglomeration/clustering, magnetic rotation and/or hyperthermia. This review focus in the interaction of CFDNPs, nanomedicine and industrial NPs with biological systems and the impact of portals of entry, particle sizes, surface charge, biomolecular corona, biodistribution, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular toxicity, anterograde and retrograde axonal transport, brain dysfunction and pathology. NPs toxicity information come from researchers synthetizing particles and improving their performance for drug delivery, drug targeting, magnetic resonance imaging and heat mediators for cancer therapy. Critical information includes how these NPs overcome all barriers, the NPs protein corona changes as they cross the NVU and the complexity of NPs interaction with soluble proteins and key organelles. Oxidative, ER and mitochondrial stress, and a faulty complex protein quality control are at the core of Alzheimer and Parkinson's diseases and NPs mechanisms of action and toxicity are strong candidates for early development and progression of both fatal diseases. Nanoparticle exposure regardless of sources carries a high risk for the developing brain homeostasis and ought to be included in the AD and PD research framework.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31299618	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299618	Alzheimer	-584688562749460923
343	343	84	Cytokine	Plasma levels of C-reactive protein, matrix metalloproteinase-7 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein distinguish active pulmonary or extrapulmonary tuberculosis from uninfected controls in children.	The immune profile associated with distinct clinical forms of tuberculosis (TB) has been extensively described for adult populations. Nevertheless, studies describing immune determinants of pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB (PTB or EPTB, respectively) in children are scarce. Here, we retrospectively assessed plasma levels of several mediators of inflammation in age and sex-matched children from South India presenting with PTB (n = 14) or EPTB (n = 22) as well as uninfected healthy controls (n = 19) to identify biomarkers that could accurately distinguish different TB clinical forms. Furthermore, we performed exploratory analyses testing the influence of sex on the systemic inflammatory profile. The analyses identified a biosignature of 10 biomarkers capable of distinguishing the three clinical groups simultaneously. Machine-learning decision trees indicated that C-reactive protein (CRP), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-7 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) were the markers that, when combined, displayed the highest accuracy in identifying the clinical groups. Additional exploratory analyses suggested that the disease signatures were highly influenced by sex. Therefore, sex differentially impacted status of systemic inflammation, immune activation and tissue remodeling in children with distinct clinical forms of TB. Regardless of such nuances related to biological sex, MMP-7, CRP and LBP were strong discriminators of active TB and thus could be considered as biomarkers useful in discrimination different TB clinical forms. These observations have implications on our understanding of the immunopathology of both clinical forms of TB in pediatric patients. If validated by other studies in the future, the combination of identified biomarkers may help development of point-of-care diagnostic or prognostic tools.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31299414	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299414	tuberculosis	5688279681867464747

Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the most occurring cardiovascular-associated disease, which is a primary leading cause of cardiac disability and death worldwide. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/RI) has been linked to IHD-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis and tissue damage. The clinical studies have indicated that pathophysiologic mechanisms of MI/RI are associated with reactive oxygen species generation, calcium overload, energy metabolism disorder, neutrophil infiltration, and others. However, the genetic mechanism of MI/RI remains unclear. In this study, we successfully established the reproducing abnormal heart observed in rat, of IHD-induced MI/RI post operation. By using these rats, we illustrated that expression of miR-181b-5p was increased not only in both hypoxia/reoxygenation-cultured H9C2 but also heart of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) rat. Suppression of the miR-181b-5p cardiomyocytes apoptosis and rescued myocardial infarction. Additionally, our data indicated that miR-181b-5p negatively regulates the expression of AKT3 and PIK3R3 through directly binding with its 3'-untranslated region. More importantly, suppression of miR-181b-5p protects the cardiomyocytes apoptosis and tissue damage from MI/R via regulation of PIK3R3 and AKT3. Hence, our study indicates that miR-181b-5p is essential for MI/RI via regulation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and could be a potential therapeutic target in IHD.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31297863	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297863	heart+disease	8210960017870928723

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a heritable disease of heart muscle that increases the risk for heart failure, stroke, and sudden death, even in asymptomatic patients. With only 10-20% of affected people currently diagnosed, there is an unmet need for an effective screening tool outside of the clinical setting. Photoplethysmography uses a noninvasive optical sensor incorporated in commercial smart watches to detect blood volume changes at the skin surface. In this study, we obtained photoplethysmography recordings and echocardiograms from 19 HCM patients with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (oHCM) and a control cohort of 64 healthy volunteers. Automated analysis showed a significant difference in oHCM patients for 38/42 morphometric pulse wave features, including measures of systolic ejection time, rate of rise during systole, and respiratory variation. We developed a machine learning classifier that achieved a C-statistic for oHCM detection of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.99-1.0). With further development, this approach could provide a noninvasive and widely available screening tool for obstructive HCM.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31304403	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304403	stroke	4999440443052714243

The growth of Web 2.0 has been particularly impactful in shaping information assessment in decision-making with regards to vaccination. The aim of the present study was to explore how attitudes and beliefs about influenza vaccination are exchanged in Web 2.0 through an analysis of user comment threads in response to related news reports on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation national news website (average of 5.8 million unique visitors per month). User comments (n = 2042) were extracted using a Google Chrome data mining extension, from 33 articles reporting on the seasonal influenza vaccine between September 2015 and October 2016. User comments were analyzed using thematic discourse analysis to identify themes within the data, and also identify how information is exchanged, including identifying the rhetorical devices and tactics used. Mostly unrelated to article content, user comments were extremely polarized with only those with strong positions at either end of the vaccination spectrum (for or against) engaging actively in online debates. Observed exchanges, and the use of rhetorical devices and tactics employed by users are identified as furthering or reinforcing polarization. In addition to exchanging information, forums served as 'echo chambers' where individuals connect with likeminded users and collect additional information to reinforce pre-existing beliefs, rather than encouraging the enrichment of user knowledge. Our data lead us to question existing calls for public health engagement in such online forums, as doing so may actually reduce the intention to vaccinate among individuals against vaccination. Rather, we identify a greater need to observe online platforms to better understand the social mechanisms that may contribute to, or reinforce, attitudes and beliefs related to influenza vaccine refusal. Further research may also explore the effect that such dialogue has on the attitudes and beliefs of passively observing individuals who have yet to decide whether to receive the flu vaccine.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	30826142	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826142	flu	-6968139157190736175

353	353	278	Analytical chemistry	Top-Down Characterization of Lipooligosaccharides from Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria.	Modification of lipooligosaccharide (LOS) structures represents one prevalent mechanism by which Gram-negative bacteria can become resistant to key antibiotics. Owing to the significant complexity of LOS, the structural characterization of these amphipathic lipids has largely focused on elucidation of the lipid A substructures. Analysis of intact LOS enables detection of core oligosaccharide modifications and gives insight into the heterogeneity that results from combinations of lipid A and oligosaccharide substructures. Top-down analysis of intact LOS also provides the opportunity to determine unknown oligosaccharide structures which is particularly advantageous in the context of glycoconjugate vaccine development. Advances in mass spectrometry technologies, including the development of MSn capabilities and alternative ion activation techniques, have made it an indispensable tool for structural characterization of complex biomolecules. Here we combine online chromatographic separations with MS3 utilizing ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) and higher energy collision dissociation (HCD). HCD generally provides information about the presence of labile modifications via neutral loss fragments in addition to the saccharide linkage arrangement, whereas UVPD gives more detailed insight about saccharide branching and the positions of non-stoichiometric modifications. This integrated approach was used to characterize LOS from Acinetobacter baumannii 1205 and 5075. Notably, MS3 analysis of A. baumannii 1205, an antibiotic resistant strain, confirmed phosphoethanolamine and hexosamine modification of the lipid A substructure and further enabled derivation of a core oligosaccharide structure.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31305072	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305072	vaccine	8754824745136110042

We investigated the incidence of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among people with COPD and whether exposure to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and exacerbation status was associated with T2DM. This descriptive cohort study used primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The patient cohort included people with a diagnosis of COPD and previous smoking history registered at a CPRD practice between January 2010 and December 2016. We determined incidence rates by age, gender and deprivation. Using a nested case-control design-where cases and controls are drawn from the cohort population-we matched 1:5 with patients by age, gender and GP practice and estimated odds of T2DM using logistic regression (adjusting for smoking status, deprivation, BMI, hypertension, coronary heart disease and heart failure). We identified 220,971 COPD patients; mean age at COPD diagnosis was 66 years (SD 12) and 54% were male. The incidence rate of T2DM in COPD patients was 1.26 per 100 patient years (95% CI: 1.24-1.28) and was higher among men (1.32 vs 1.18 among women). The adjusted odds ratio for T2DM was 1.47 (95% CI: 1.36-1.60) among frequent exacerbators (≥2 treated exacerbations per year) compared to infrequent exacerbators and the odds ratio for patients receiving high-dose ICS (>800 mcg budesonide equivalent dose) was 1.73 (95% CI 1.65-1.82) compared to patients receiving no ICS therapy. Incidence of T2DM among COPD patients is high and exposure to ICS and frequent exacerbations are associated with a higher risk of T2DM among patients with COPD.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31308364	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308364	heart+disease	5508043659570633487

On one side this is due to trends in population towards aging and obesity resulting in a higher prevalence of steatosis/steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. On the other side, inflammatory origin, especially due to viral hepatitis, is one of the primary reasons for diffuse liver disease. This chapter will describe the most common imaging features of hepatic metabolic and storage diseases, including overload with fat, iron, copper, and amyloid and diffuse neoplastic diseases. We also discuss focal and diffuse infectious and inflammatory hepatic diseases. Key imaging manifestations of fungal, granulomatous, parasitic, viral, and bacterial as well as the less common hepatic infections such as cat-scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis, and amebic disease are reviewed to avoid pitfalls in image interpretation. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides unique capabilities for noninvasive and quantitative characterization of liver tissue that rival the diagnostic utility of liver biopsies, also characteristic imaging findings with computed tomography (CT) that are useful in daily clinical routine will be discussed.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314369	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314369	obesity	3727587882617538492

Germline mutations in SAMD9 and SAMD9L genes cause MIRAGE (OMIM: *610456) and ataxia-pancytopenia (OMIM: *611170) syndromes, respectively, and are associated with chromosome 7 deletions, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and bone marrow failure. In this retrospective series, we report outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with hematologic disorders associated with SAMD9/SAMD9L mutations. Twelve patients underwent allogeneic HCT for MDS (n=10), congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (n=1), and dyskeratosis congenita (n=1). Exome sequencing revealed heterozygous mutations in SAMD9 (n=6) or SAMD9L (n=6) genes. Four SAMD9 patients had features of MIRAGE syndrome. Median age at HCT was 2.8 years (range: 1.2-12.8). Conditioning was myeloablative in 9 cases and reduced-intensity in 3 cases. Syndrome-related comorbidities (diarrhea, infections, adrenal insufficiency, malnutrition, and electrolyte imbalance) were present in MIRAGE syndrome cases. One patient with a familial SAMD9L mutation, MDS and morbid obesity failed to engraft and died from refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The other 11 patients achieved neutrophil engraftment. Acute post-transplant course was complicated by syndrome related comorbidities in MIRAGE cases. A patient with SAMD9L associated MDS, died of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The other 10 patients had resolution of hematological disorder and sustained peripheral blood donor chimerism. Ten out of 12 patients were alive with a median follow-up of 3.1 years (range: 0.1-14.7). More data are needed to refine transplant approaches in SAMD9/SAMD9L patients with significant comorbidities and to develop guidelines for their long-term follow-up.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31306780	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306780	obesity	2871648046424590878

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease leading to a gradual and irreversible loss of memory, linguistic skills, and perception of time and space, thinking, and behavior. Dietary pattern has been presented as a contributor to the incidence of Alzheimer's. This study aimed at reviewing the evidence on the relation between dietary pattern and AD. This systematic search was performed on the articles available in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Sciences databases until May 2019 using keywords, including (diet, food, dietary pattern, food pattern) and (Alzheimer's disease) among observational studies. After excluding duplicated, and irrelevant studies, 26 studies were eligible for this review study. We categorized the studied dietary patterns into two groups: healthy and unhealthy diet. This study reviewed two case-control, five cross-sectional, and 19 prospective studies. Eight studies assessed unhealthy diet (high-fat diet, high-glycemic diet, sweetened sugary beverage, etc.) and the risk of AD. In addition, the other studies considered the effect of healthy diet such as Mediterranean diet, dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean-DASH intervention for neurodegenerative delay, and seafood-rich diet on AD. This literature review indicated that adherence to a healthy dietary pattern has neuroprotective effects on AD prevention, while unhealthy diet can cause neurodegenerative effects in AD etiology. In conclusion, our findings showed that adherence to healthy diet can decrease oxidative stress and inflammation and accumulation of amyloid-β and consequently can decrease the risk of AD.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Italy	31240575	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31240575	Alzheimer	-8099709040471107382
367	367	393	Acta biomaterialia	Compressive Deformation and Failure of Trabecular Structures in A Turtle Shell.	Turtle shells comprising of cortical and trabecular bones exhibit intriguing mechanical properties. In this work, compression tests were performed using specimens made from the carapace of Kinixys erosa turtle. A combination of imaging techniques and mechanical testing were employed to examine the responses of hierarchical microstructures of turtle shell under compression. Finite element models produced from microCT-scanned microstructures and analytical foam structure models were then used to elucidate local responses of trabecular bones deformed under compression. The results reveal the contributions from micro-strut bending and stress concentrations to the fractural mechanisms of trabecular bone structures. The porous structures of turtle shells could be an excellent prototype for the bioinspired design of deformation-resistant structures. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, a combination of analytical, computational models and experiments is used to study the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the compressive deformation of a Kinixys erosa turtle shell between the nano-, micro- and macro-scales. The proposed work shows that the turtle shell structures can be analyzed as sandwich structures that have the capacity to concentrate deformation and stresses within the trabecular bones, which enables significant energy absorption during compressive deformation. Then, the trends in the deformation characteristics and the strengths of the trabecular bone segments are well predicted by the four-strut model, which captures the effects of variations in strut length, thickness and orientation that are related to microstructural uncertainties of the turtle shells. The above results also suggest that the model may be used to guide the bioinspired design of sandwich porous structures that mimic the properties of the cortical and trabecular bone segments of turtle shells under a range of loading conditions.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31310853	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310853	stress	-1861959619649725543

It can be based on various criteria such as face image, DNA methylation, chest plate radiographs, knee radiographs, dental images and etc. Most of the age prediction researches have mainly been based on images. Since the image processing and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have grown up, the investigations were led to use them in age prediction problem. The implementations would be used in different fields, especially in medical applications. Brain Age Estimation (BAE) has attracted more attention in recent years and it would be so helpful in early diagnosis of some neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, etc. BAE is performed on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images to compute the brain ages. Studies based on brain MRI shows that there is a relation between accelerated aging and accelerated brain atrophy. This refers to the effects of neurodegenerative diseases on brain structure while making the whole of it older. This paper reviews and summarizes the main approaches for age prediction based on brain MRI images including preprocessing methods, useful tools used in different research works and the estimation algorithms. We categorize the BAE methods based on two factors, first the way of processing MRI images, which includes pixel-based, surface-based, or voxel-based methods and second, the generation of ML algorithms that includes traditional or Deep Learning (DL) methods. The modern techniques as DL methods help MRI based age prediction to get results that are more accurate. In recent years, more precise and statistical ML approaches have been utilized with the help of related tools for simplifying computations and getting accurate results. Pros and cons of each research and the challenges in each work are expressed and some guidelines and deliberations for future research are suggested.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31297614	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297614	Alzheimer	1507299850679912107

BACKGROUND Inappropriate use of antibiotics results in antimicrobial resistance and dysbacteriosis. Among critically ill cirrhotic patients, consensus regarding the most optimal prescription strategy for antibiotics use has not been achieved. For these patients, the score for end-stage liver disease (MELD) demonstrated its value in predicting prognosis of cirrhosis. This study investigated use of the MELD score to guide antibiotics choice. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 1250 patients with cirrhosis. We collected patient information, including antibiotics administration. Linear regression analyses were performed to determine independent predictors of antibiotic administration. Survival curves were constructed based on Cox regression models. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate the hazard ratio, shown by forest plots. RESULTS The population was equally stratified into 4 groups based on the MELD score (Q1: MELD <10; Q2: 10≤ MELD <17; Q3: 17≤ MELD <26; Q4: 26≤ MELD). In Q1, all the HR (hazard ratio) related to the duration of antibiotics use demonstrated no statistical significance. In Q2, the HR related to the duration of antibiotics use revealed a successive decrease. In Q3, the HR showed statistical significance only with a duration of antibiotics use of 7 days or more. In Q4, all the HR were statistically significant. As for categories of antibiotics use, whatever the MELD score was, the HR continued to increase with ascending categories. CONCLUSIONS For low MELD score patients (MELD <17), changing the duration of antibiotics use was not associated with a better prognosis. For high MELD score patients (MELD ≥17), longer duration of antibiotics use was associated with a reduction in mortality. Whatever the MELD score was, an increase of number of antibiotic categories was positively associat ed with poor prognosis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31278890	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31278890	Cirrhosis	5189433264884433830

380	380	350	Journal of psychosocial nursing and mental health services	Depression Screening Among African American Adults in the Primary Care Setting.	Although depression is treatable with medication and psychotherapy, it is often left undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in African American communities. African American patients may experience poor outcomes when medical problems coexist with undiagnosed and untreated mental health issues, such as depression. This is a concern because depression can inhibit compliance with providers' treatment plans. A major factor in treatment of depression is assessment and recognition of the condition itself so that a proper diagnosis and treatment plan can be determined. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of a depression screening tool on depression diagnoses and treatment initiation in African American patients in a primary care setting. In 200 patients prior to screening implementaion, none were screened or diagnosed with depression. After routine implementation of a depression screening tool, 75 of 182 patients were diagnosed with depression. Using a routine screening tool resulted in a 41% increase in diagnoses of depression. The integration of routine depression screening in the primary care setting may improve overall health outcomes and competence in implementation of care.

A 19-year-old patient presented with severe chest pain, which is not typical for cardiac angina. However, his smoking history and the strong family history of ischaemic heart disease coupled with evidence of progressive T-wave changes on his electrocardiogram (ECG) caused dilemma in deciding further management. His blood tests were normal apart from hypophosphataemia, and he had two negative troponin results. His arterial blood gases showed respiratory alkalosis. He was given analgesia for a diagnosis of musculoskeletal chest pain and the next morning his ECG, arterial blood gases and phosphate levels all normalised. He had a normal echocardiogram and was reviewed by the cardiologist who diagnosed musculoskeletal chest pain which led to distress and hyperventilation causing hypophosphataemia and transient T-wave inversion. This case is a reminder of an under-recognised physiological phenomenon involving the cardiac conduction during hyperventilation.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31308117	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308117	heart+disease	-8426084422061984285
385	385	480	Internal and emergency medicine	The effect of management models on thromboembolic and bleeding rates in anticoagulated patients: an ecological study.	The primary study objective is to compare the outcomes of patients taking oral anticoagulant medications in two distinct populations treated according to different management models (comprehensive vs. usual care). (Design: regional prospective cohort study; setting: hospital admission data from two regions). Eligible partecipants were patients taking oral anticoagulant drugs (vitamin K antagonist or direct oral anticoagulants), residents in the Vicenza and Cremona districts from February 1st, 2016 to June 30th, 2017. Patients were identified by accessing the administrative databases of patient drug prescriptions. The primary study outcome was admission to the Emergency Department for stroke, systemic arterial embolism, recurrence of venous thromboembolism or major bleeding. The study evaluated outcomes in 14,226 patients taking oral anticoagulants, of whom 6725 being followed in Cremona with a comprehensive management model. There were 19 and 45 thromboembolic events over 6205 and 6530 patient-years in the Cremona and Vicenza cohort, respectively (IRR 0.44, 95% CI 0.24-0.77). The reduction of events in the Cremona cohort was almost entirely explained by a decrease of events in patients taking VKA (IRR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20-0.78) but not DOACs (IRR 1.08, 95% CI 0.25-5.24). The rate of major bleeding was non-significantly higher in Cremona than in Vicenza (IRI 1.32; 95% CI 0.74-2.40). Across the two cohorts, the risk of bleeding was lower in patients being treated with DOACs rather than warfarin (10/4574 vs. 42/8161 event/person-years, respectively, IRR 0.42 95% CI 0.19-0.86). We conclude that a comprehensive management model providing centralized dose prescription and follow-up may significantly reduce the rate of thromboembolic complications, without substantially increasing the number of bleeding complications. Patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants appear to have a rate of thromboembolic complications comparable to VKA patients under the best management model, with a reduction of major bleeding.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Italy	31309520	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309520	stroke	-9153494109165200346

We describe 2 pediatric cases presenting with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome secondary to autonomic dysfunction preceding the onset of motor symptoms in Guillain-Barré syndrome variants. Patient 1 presented acutely with encephalopathy, cerebellar signs, hypertension, lower limb weakness, and respiratory decompensation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain showed occipital lesions consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Nerve conduction studies were consistent with Miller-Fisher syndrome. After intravenous immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis, he improved clinically with radiological resolution. Patient 2 presented with headache, leg pain, seizures, and significant hypertension. Brain MRI was normal but spine MRI revealed enhancement of the cauda equina ventral nerve roots. She was areflexic with lower limb weakness a few days after intensive care unit admission and made a significant improvement after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. In children presenting with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in the absent of other causes of primary hypertension, Guillain-Barré syndrome variants are an important differential etiology, presenting with autonomic dysfunction, even before signs of motor weakness become evident.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31259196	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31259196	headache	865977730460714234
388	388	599	Physiotherapy theory and practice	Relationship between symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse and respiratory muscle strength in middle-aged and older women in Northeast Brazil: a cross-sectional study.	Some respiratory muscles work in synergy with the pelvic floor (PF). Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is characterized by weak PF muscles and has been associated with worse pulmonary ventilation function in women. To date no studies have investigated the association between respiratory muscle strength and POP. This study aimed to determine whether symptomatic POP is associated with respiratory muscle strength in middle-aged and older women. In this observational cross-sectional study, 204 community-dwelling women (41-80 years old) from Santa Cruz (Northeastern Brazil) provided information on socioeconomic characteristics, health behavior, reproductive history and symptomatic POP via a structured questionnaire. A digital manometer was used to measure their maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP and MEP). Multiple linear regression analyses, adjusted for covariates (age, income, education, body mass index, and smoking), evaluated the association between POP and MIP/MEP. The results show that 14.7% of the sample reported symptomatic POP. These women exhibited lower mean MIP and MEP than those reporting no POP, but the intergroup difference was only significant for MEP (	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31294670	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31294670	smoking	2335028422423709400
389	389	545	Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology	Correlation of Inhaled Long-acting Bronchodilators with Adverse Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Stable COPD: A Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.	A majority of existing studies have focused on the efficacy of inhaled long-acting bronchodilators (ILABs), such as long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) and long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs), and LABAs combined with LAMAs in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The current meta-analysis aimed to investigate the correlation of ILABs with specific cardiovascular adverse events (CAEs). Five electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science, were systematically retrieved. Finally, 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were enrolled into the current meta-analysis. Typically, the efficacy of 3 major classes of drugs (LABAs, LAMAs, as well as LABAs combined with LAMAs), as well as 7 specific drugs (including Formoterol, Glycopyrrolate, Indacaterol, Olodaterol, Salmeterol, Tiotropium, and Vilanterol) for 4 CAEs, including myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac failure (CF), ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke in stable COPD patients, was examined. All the pooled results were analyzed through the odds ratios (ORs) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The direct meta-analysis results suggested that LABAs could increase the risk of CF in patients with stable COPD compared with placebo controls (OR 1.70, 95%CI 1.00-2.90). In addition, network meta-analysis results indicated that LAMAs combined with LABAs would result in an increased risk of CF in patients with stable COPD (OR 2.31, 95%CI 1.10-5.09). According to the ILABs specific drug analysis, Formoterol might potentially have protective effects on IHD compared with placebo controls (OR 0.45, 95%CI 0.18-1.00). In conclusion, among these three kinds of ILABs, including LAMAs, LABAs, and LABAs /LAMAs, for stable COPD patients, LAMAs and LABAs are associated with the least possibility to induce MI and stroke, respectively. However, the application of LABAs will probably increase the risk of CF, they should be used with caution for stable COPD patients with CF. In addition, in specific-drug analysis, the use of formoterol can reduce the risk of treatment-related IHD. Nevertheless, more studies on different drug doses are needed in the future to further validate this conclusion.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31306366	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306366	stroke	7071371416976898441

394	394	19	Scientific reports	Arterial tissue transcriptional profiles associate with tissue remodeling and cardiovascular phenotype in children with end-stage kidney disease.	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) greatly increases the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, molecular mechanisms underlying CKD-induced arterial remodeling are largely unknown. We performed a systematic analysis of arterial biopsies from children with stage 5 predialysis CKD participating in the Cardiovascular Comorbidity in Children with Chronic Kidney Disease (4 C) study. For comparison, we studied biopsies from children without CKD, coronary bypass vessels from adults with atherosclerotic coronary heart disease without CKD and aortic sections of subtotally nephrectomized rats. In pediatric CKD patients, gene expression was correlated to the cardiovascular phenotype assessed by surrogate end-points. The arterial calcium content correlated with the intima-media thickness (IMT) of biopsied vessels from pediatric CKD patients, was markedly increased compared to biopsies from children without CKD and comparable to adult coronary bypass patients. Significant transcriptional changes included ECM components, pro-calcifying factors, and physiological calcification inhibitors; most were highly accordant with changes observed in adults with atherosclerosis and in uremic rats. Individual gene expression levels were significantly associated with the left ventricular mass index and carotid intima media thickness. Thus, inflammatory processes (TNF, IL-10), calcification inhibitors (CA2), the Wnt-pathway (FGF-2) and foremost, ECM components (HMGA1, VNN1, VCAN), impact pathobiological responses in arteries from children with CKD.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31311999	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311999	heart+disease	5442191984600038712

A 74-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with epigastric pain, severe nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea that had started 3 days previously. She had eaten raw Ayu fish 4 days before admission. An abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed the presence of gas in the portal vein and remarkable thickening of the gastric wall. In many cases, the gas in the portal vein indicates the existence of intestinal necrosis. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a submucosal tumor-like elevation in the gastric corpus. She was diagnosed with sepsis and phlegmonous gastritis (PG) with hepatic portal venous gas (HPVG) caused by Aeromonas hydrophila, which was detected in her stool. The patient was treated with antibiotics and discharged from the hospital 23 days after admission in a stable condition. When caused by PG, HPVG is not necessarily considered a poor prognostic factor and is expected to be treatable with medication. However, patients should be closely monitored for signs of a life-threatening pathology such as intestinal necrosis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Japan	31302879	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302879	Diarrhea	-2151750849426701342
396	396	11	 	Principles of Conditioning Therapy and Cell Infusion	Prior to haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), conditioning therapy is used for disease eradication, creation of space for engraftment and immunosuppression. Conditioning therapy includes combinations of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and/or immunotherapy. Chemotherapy is delivered in different phases: induction, consolidation and maintenance. Total body irradiation (TBI) is widely used as part of conditioning regimens preceding allogeneic HSCT and is able to target sanctuary sites where some drugs cannot reach. Cancer immunotherapy treatment harnesses the body’s natural defences to fight the cancer, by involving components of the immune system. Conditioning therapy can have acute and chronic side effects due to the toxicity of the treatment. Nursing implications involve patient education and information, toxicity assessments, close monitoring and action plans. Stem cell infusion is usually a safe procedure but can cause adverse reactions ranging from flushing and nausea to life-threatening reactions. There should be written policies for the administration of cellular therapy products, and nurses must have training and competency in order to safely administer haematopoietic stem cells.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314314	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314314	cancer	8181531374206668183

Aging is associated with changes in the structure and function of the lung that may increase susceptibility to chronic lung diseases. The aim of this study was the morphometric assessment of the non-epithelial areas of the bronchioles of mouse through the normal aging process. Lungs from CD1 mice at the age of 2, 6, 12, 18, or 24 months were fixed in neutral-buffered formalin and paraffin-embedded. Sections were cut, stained with Masson trichrome, and examined using a light microscope. High-resolution color images were captured using a camera linked to image analysis software to measure areas and lengths. We observed in the bronchioles through the aging process an increase of the total area, an increase of the lumen area, and a decrease of the wall area. In conclusion, our results revealed structural changes in the bronchioles of mouse through the normal aging process. These alterations are likely to contribute to development of chronic lung diseases.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31312374	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312374	aging	4340103631421550622

Guanabenz (GBZ), an α2-adrenergic agonist, demonstrated off-target effects that restored protein homeostasis and ameliorated pathobiology in experimental models of neurodegenerative disease. However, GBZ did not directly activate the integrated stress response (ISR) and its proposed mode of action remains controversial. Utilizing an iterative in silico screen of over 10,000 GBZ analogues, we analyzed 432 representative compounds for cytotoxicity in Wild-type, PPP1R15A-/- and PPP1R15B-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Nine compounds clustering into three functional groups were studied in detail using cell biological and biochemical assays. Our studies demonstrated that PromISR-6 as a potent GBZ analogue that selectively activated ISR, eliciting sustained eIF2α phosphorylation. ISRIB, an ISR inhibitor, counteracted PromISR-6-mediated translational inhibition and reduction in intracellular mutant Huntingtin aggregates. Reduced protein synthesis combined with PromISR-6-stimulated autophagic clearance made PromISR-6, the most efficacious GBZ analogue to reduce Huntingtin aggregates and promote survival in a cellular model of Huntington's disease.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313908	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313908	stress	8314492264050843009

Relationships between high depression scores and variables related to infants' care, sleep and growth were assessed adjusting for other variables. High depression scores were found in 233 mothers, which were associated with variables related to infants' care (poor satisfaction with infant care support, p < 0.001; mothers' passive response to night-time fussing, p = 0.001), sleep (dim bedroom lighting, p < 0.05; short sleep duration, p < 0.05) and growth (poor weight gain, p < 0.05), as well as maternal variables (primiparas, p < 0.001; poor income satisfaction, p < 0.001; poor sleep satisfaction, p < 0.001; daytime sleepiness, p = 0.001).

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 1 is a major cause of swine morbidity and mortality in various parts of the world, including Hungary. A national elimination programme to reduce the associated economic burden was initiated in Hungary in 2012. Using extensive laboratory surveillance, we identified and isolated an unusual PRRSV strain. The complete coding sequence of this isolate was determined and analyzed. The genome of this Hungarian PRRSV1 strain, HUN60077/16, is 15,081 nucleotides in length. Phylogenetic and recombination analysis showed a mosaic structure of the genome where a large fragment of ORF1b and the genomic region coding for ORF3 to ORF7 showed a very close genetic relationship to the vaccine virus Unistrain, while the ORF1a region, the 3' end of ORF1b, and the whole ORF2 were only distantly related to this or any other PRRSV1 strain whose genome sequence is available in the GenBank database. Genomic characterization of PRRSV strains is crucial when possible vaccine-associated cases are identified. This approach not only helps to identify genetic interactions between vaccine and wild-type PRRSV1 strains but may also be needed to prevent trust in commercial vaccines from being undermined.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Austria	31300889	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300889	vaccine	7247406924790318523

The age of the patients ranged from 1 to 215 months (17.92 y), with a mean age of 5.19±5.25 years. AIS accounted for the majority of cases (n=69, 58.5%), and the major etiology was cardiac disease (17%). Hemorrhagic stroke accounted for 19.5% (n=23) of the cases, and late hemorrhagic disease of the newborn was the major etiology (43%, n=10). SVT accounted for 22% (n=26) of the cases, and the major etiology was otitis media-mastoiditis (27%, n=7). Hemiplegia and headache were the most frequent symptoms for AIS and SVT, respectively. Stroke is rare in children compared with adults; however, it is detected more frequently with better imaging techniques and increased awareness. We found that children with AIS presented more commonly with hemiplegia and children with SVT with headache and strabismus. We did not find an association between thrombophilia and stroke.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31259821	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31259821	headache	-8196748324041706598

Quantitative analysis of site specific glycoforms of proteins is technically challenging but highly desirable; resolution of the fucosylated glycoforms is of particular interest due to their biological importance. In this study, we developed a sensitive and specific LC-MS-MRM quantification method that distinguishes the outer arm and core fucosylated configurations of the N-glycopeptides. We take advantage of limited fragmentation of the glycopeptides at low collision energy CID to produce linkage-specific Y-ions. We select these informative ions as MRM transitions for the quantification of the outer arm and total fucosylation of 12 fucosylated glycoforms of 9 glycopeptides in 7 plasma proteins. Our workflow showed improved sensitivity and specificity of quantification of the glycopeptides compared to oxonium ion transitions which allowed us to quantify the glycoforms directly in plasma or serum without fractionation of the samples or glycopeptide enrichment. A pilot study of fucosylation in liver cirrhosis of the HCV and NASH etiologies confirms the quantitative capabilities of the method and shows that liver cirrhosis is consistently associated with increased outer arm fucosylation of majority of the analyzed proteins. The results show that the outer arm fucosylation of the A2G2F1 glycoform of the VDKDLQSLEDILHQVENK peptide of fibrinogen increases greater than 10-fold in the HCV and NASH patients compared to healthy controls.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31268672	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31268672	Cirrhosis	6793894801847439981

The purpose of this case study is to examine how environmental disruption and agricultural practices act synergistically to create a perfect storm for the spread of avian influenza. Actors in this case study include the vast permafrost landscape of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; a wild goose that migrates over the Himalayas; the highest altitude railway in the world that traverses the plateau into Tibet; and an avian virus (H5N1). Commencing in 2001, tens of thousands of railway workers travelled to remote regions of the plateau to work on the railway. In order to feed and shelter these workers, the Chinese government established captive-bred goose farms as a source of high protein food. Beginning in 2005 and continuing in subsequent years, Qinghai Lake was the scene for the unprecedented appearance of avian influenza among migratory geese. This was a key moment in the global spread of H5N1 to poultry on three continents. Remote sensing technology suggested an ecological pathway for the transfer of avian viruses among chickens, captive-bred geese, and wild geese. Within a region experiencing rapid climate change, Qinghai Lake is warming even faster than the global average. This may relate to the persistent outbreaks of avian flu strains from Qinghai during the past twelve years. Globally, exponential increases in bird flu outbreaks are not merely a matter of chance mutations in flu viruses but also a result of antecedent social and environmental factors. The Qinghai case study provides real-world examples that bring these factors into sharp focus.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31063711	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063711	flu	-8391512412740651574

The alveolus participates in gas exchange, which can be impaired by environmental factors and toxins. There is an increase in using electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes); however, their effect on human primary alveolar epithelial cells is unknown. Human lungs were obtained from non-smoker organ donors to isolate alveolar type II (ATII) cells. ATII cells produce and secrete pulmonary surfactant, restore the epithelium after damage and their metabolism highly depends on mitochondrial function. Our data indicates that human ATII cell exposure to e-cigarette aerosol increased IL-8 levels and induced DNA damage and apoptosis. We also studied the cytoprotective effect of DJ-1 against ATII cell injury. DJ-1 knockdown in human primary ATII cells sensitized cells to mitochondrial dysfunction as detected by high mitochondrial superoxide production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and calcium elevation. DJ-1 KO mice were more susceptible to ATII cell apoptosis and lung injury induced by e-cigarette aerosol compared to wild-type mice. Regulation of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is important for mitochondrial function and protection against oxidative stress. Major subunits of the OXPHOS system are encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. We found dysregulation of OXPHOS complexes in DJ-1 KO mice after exposure to e-cigarette aerosol, which could disrupt the nuclear/mitochondrial stoichiometry, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction. Together, our results indicate that DJ-1 deficiency sensitizes ATII cells to damage induced by e-cigarette aerosol leading to lung injury.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313616	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313616	stress	7620697593009487898

The endothelium is a single cell layer that plays a critical role in determining the health and function of blood vessels. Endothelial function is shaped by shear stress, the frictional force exerted by the speed of blood flow, and the thickness (viscosity) of the blood. Exposure to shear stress that reverses direction back-and-forth impairs endothelial function in young men. Whether women are equally susceptible to this perturbation and the isolated impact of a low level of shear stress with and without reversal of shear had not been investigated. Hypoxia, the low levels of oxygen that are experienced at high altitude, has been shown to influence flow reversal and impair endothelial function. However, no previous study had accounted for the changes in blood thickness, and hence shear stress that occur at high altitude. This may be especially important in the context of excessive erythrocytosis, a high-altitude disease characterized by exceptionally thick blood and increased cardiovascular risk.

Network dysfunction is well established in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has been shown to be present early in the disease. This is especially interesting in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) since they are more likely to develop AD. In EEG, one type of network analysis is microstates where the EEG is divided into quasi-stable states and these microstates have been linked to networks found with resting state functional MRI. In the current exploratory study, we therefore wanted to explore the changes in microstates in MCI, and AD compared to healthy controls (HC) and whether microstates were able to separate patients with MCI who progressed (pMCI) and those who remained stable (sMCI). EEGs were recorded at baseline for 17 patients with AD, 27 patients with MCI, and 38 older HC and the patients were followed for 3 years. To investigate whole-brain dynamics we extracted different microstate parameters. We found that patients with MCI, and AD had significantly higher occurrence (	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31263397	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263397	Alzheimer	-3211843544085892873

426	426	298	Current genetics	The AP-1-like transcription factor ChAP1 balances tolerance and cell death in the response of the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus to a plant phenolic.	Fungal pathogens need to contend with stresses including oxidants and antimicrobial chemicals resulting from host defenses. ChAP1 of Cochliobolus heterostrophus, agent of Southern corn leaf blight, encodes an ortholog of yeast YAP1. ChAP1 is retained in the nucleus in response to plant-derived phenolic acids, in addition to its well-studied activation by oxidants. Here, we used transcriptome profiling to ask which genes are regulated in response to ChAP1 activation by ferulic acid (FA), a phenolic abundant in the maize host. Nuclearization of ChAP1 in response to phenolics is not followed by strong expression of genes needed for oxidative stress tolerance. We, therefore, compared the transcriptomes of the wild-type pathogen and a ChAP1 deletion mutant, to study the function of ChAP1 in response to FA. We hypothesized that if ChAP1 is retained in the nucleus under plant-related stress conditions yet in the absence of obvious oxidant stress, it should have additional regulatory functions. The transcriptional signature in response to FA in the wild type compared to the mutant sheds light on the signaling mechanisms and response pathways by which ChAP1 can mediate tolerance to ferulic acid, distinct from its previously known role in the antioxidant response. The ChAP1-dependent FA regulon consists mainly of two large clusters. The enrichment of transport and metabolism-related genes in cluster 1 indicates that C. heterostrophus degrades FA and removes it from the cell. When this fails at increasing stress levels, FA provides a signal for cell death, indicated by the enrichment of cell death-related genes in cluster 2. By quantitation of survival and by TUNEL assays, we show that ChAP1 promotes survival and mitigates cell death. Growth rate data show a time window in which the mutant colony expands faster than the wild type. The results delineate a transcriptional regulatory pattern in which ChAP1 helps balance a survival response for tolerance to FA, against a pathway promoting cell death in the pathogen. A general model for the transition from a phase where the return to homeostasis dominates to a phase leading to the onset of cell death provides a context for understanding these findings.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31312934	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312934	stress	230807360572081472

Many synthetic glucocorticoids from medical applications occur in the aquatic environment. Whether they pose a risk for fish health is poorly known. Here we investigate effects of glucocorticoids fluticasone propionate (FLU) and triamcinolone acetonide (TRI) as single steroids and as ternary mixtures with clobetasol propionate (CLO) in zebrafish embryos. Exposure to FLU and TRI in a range of concentrations between 0.099 and 120.08 μg/L led to concentration-related decrease in muscle contractions and increase in heart rate at 0.98 and 1.05 μg/L, respectively, and higher. Genes encoding for proteins related to glucose metabolism (g6pca, pepck1), immune system regulation (fkbp5, irg1l, socs3, gilz) and matrix metalloproteinases mmp-9 and mmp-13 showed expressional alterations, as well as genes encoding for the progestin receptor (pgr) and corticosteroid dehydrogenase (hsd11b2). FLU accelerated hatching and led to embryotoxicity (immobilization and edema). Ternary mixtures (FLU + TRI + CLO) induced the same physiological and toxicological effects at concentrations of individual glucocorticoids of 11.1-16.37 μg/L and higher. Heart rate was increased in the mixture at concentrations as low as 0.0885-0.11 μg/L of each steroid. Glucocorticoids in mixtures showed additive activity; the fold-changes of transcripts of 19 target genes were additive. Together, our data show that glucocorticoids act additively and their joint activity may be of concern for developing fish in contaminated environments.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	30981015	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981015	flu	-5784228041033890044

Insecure attachment to parents consistently correlates with adolescent depression. However, the order of cause and effect, the impact of confounding, and gender disparities in this relationship remain unresolved. The present study therefore examined the prospective associations between attachment relationships to mothers and fathers and depressive symptoms in a community sample of Spanish children (n = 904; 49.4% females) assessed biennially from age 10-16 years, net of all unmeasured time-invariant confounding. Insecure relationships predicted depressive symptoms, and more so among girls, but depressive symptoms also forecasted worsened attachment relationships. At ages 12-14, mother-child attachment proved to be more important for the development of depressive symptoms than father-child attachment. These findings reveal a pattern of reciprocal influence between attachment relationships and depressive symptoms that appears to vary as a function of the parental and child's gender and developmental period. Thus, efforts aimed at strengthening the parent-child attachment relationship-across the transition from middle childhood to adolescence-may prevent or reduce depressive symptoms, especially by targeting mothers and female adolescents.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31309415	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309415	depression	-7447329442374055391
430	430	271	DNA repair	Roles of OGG1 in transcriptional regulation and maintenance of metabolic homeostasis.	Cellular damage produced by conditions generating oxidative stress have far-reaching implications in human disease that encompass, but are not restricted to aging, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, airway inflammation/asthma, cancer, and metabolic syndrome including visceral obesity, insulin resistance, fatty liver disease, and dyslipidemia. Although there are numerous sources and cellular targets of oxidative stress, this review will highlight literature that has investigated downstream consequences of oxidatively-induced DNA damage in both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. The presence of such damage can in turn, directly and indirectly modulate cellular transcriptional and repair responses to such stressors. As such, the persistence of base damage can serve as a key regulator in coordinated gene-response cascades. Conversely, repair of these DNA lesions serves as both a suppressor of mutagenesis and by inference carcinogenesis, and as a signal for the cessation of ongoing oxidative stress. A key enzyme in all these processes is 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), which, via non-catalytic binding to oxidatively-induced DNA damage in promoter regions, serves as a nucleation site around which changes in large-scale regulation of inflammation-associated gene expression can occur. Further, the catalytic function of OGG1 can alter the three-dimensional structure of specialized DNA sequences, leading to changes in transcriptional profiles. This review will concentrate on adverse deleterious health effects that are associated with both the diminution of OGG1 activity via population-specific polymorphic variants and the complete loss of OGG1 in murine models. This mouse model displays diet- and age-related induction of metabolic syndrome, highlighting a key role for OGG1 in protecting against these phenotypes. Conversely, recent investigations using murine models having enhanced global expression of a mitochondrial-targeted OGG1 demonstrate that they are highly resistant to diet-induced disease. These data suggest strategies through which therapeutic interventions could be designed for reducing or limiting adverse human health consequences to these ubiquitous stressors.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31311771	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311771	diabetes	6090089162789916215

Rhinogenic headache (RH) is a widespread pain syndrome but its pathogenesis and treatment are still unclear.

The authors conducted a retrospective case-control study to analyze the correlation between radiological findings and clinical symptoms.One hundred-nineteen adults with Para-Nasal Sinuses Computed Tomography (PNS-CT) scans were included: 64 patients who have originally undergone PNS-CT scan as part of rhinogenic headache workup (Group A), and 55 controls in whom PNS-CT scans were obtained for other purposes (Group B). All subjects were asked to report their symptoms using a headache scoring system. PNS-CT scans of all subjects were analyzed for presence of mucosal contact points, middle turbinate concha bullosa (MTCB) and frontoethmoidal cells.The most common anatomical abnormality found in our series was MTCB, reported in 60.9% of patients in Group A and 41.8% of those in Group B. A statistically significant prevalence was found in Group A compared to Group B regarding the presence of MTCB (P = 0.037) and Type II (P = 0.016) and Type III (P = 0.039) frontoethmoidal cells. No statistically significant difference (P >0.05) was found between Group A and Group B regarding the presence of mucosal contact points at each site.Multiple anatomical variations in nasal and paranasal sinuses may cause a rhinogenic headache with different characteristics. Some of these, such as concha bullosa of middle turbinate or type II and III Kuhn cells, have shown a significant association with rhinogenic headache. No statistically significant association was found between presence of headache and mucosal contact points and type I and IV frontal cells.

Current cancer diagnosis involves the use of nuclear morphology and chromatin condensation signatures for accurate advanced stage classification. While such diagnostic approaches rely on high resolution imaging of the cell nucleus using expensive microscopy systems, developing portable mobile microscopes to visualize nuclear and chromatin condensation patterns is desirable at clinical settings with limited infrastructure. In this study, we develop a portable fluorescent mobile microscope capable of acquiring high resolution images of the nucleus and chromatin. Using this we extracted nuclear morphometric and chromatin texture based features and were able to discriminate between normal and cancer cells with similar accuracy as wide-field fluorescence microscopy. We were also able to detect subtle changes in nuclear and chromatin features in cells subjected to compressive forces, cytoskeletal perturbations and cytokine stimulation, thereby highlighting the sensitivity of the portable microscope. Taken together, we present a versatile platform to exploit nuclear morphometrics and chromatin condensation features as physical biomarkers for point-of-care diagnostic solutions.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31314779	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314779	cancer	-5570256785328462468

Obesity is associated with ~40% of cancer diagnoses but there are currently no effective preventive strategies, illustrating a need for chemoprevention. We previously demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) from adipose tissue stimulates malignant transformation, as measured by growth in soft agar, the gold-standard in vitro transformation assay. Because the soft agar assay is unsuitable for high throughput screens (HTS), we developed a novel method using 3D growth in ultra-low attachment conditions as an alternative to growth in agar to discover compounds that inhibit transformation.

Sacral agenesis is a rare birth defect characterized by partial or complete absence of the sacrum. We sought to (a) describe case characteristics, (b) estimate birth prevalence, and (c) identify risk factors for nonsyndromic sacral agenesis using data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS). The NBDPS was a population-based, case-control study involving pregnancies with estimated dates of delivery from October 1997 through December 2011. We estimated birth prevalence using all NBDPS eligible cases. Using self-reported maternal exposure information, we conducted multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify potential risk factors overall and among women without diabetes. The birth prevalence of sacral agenesis was 2.6/100,000 live births. In the multivariable analysis, multifetal pregnancy, pre-existing Type 1 diabetes, and pre-existing Type 2 diabetes were positively and significantly associated with sacral agenesis, albeit estimates were imprecise. Preexisting Type 1 diabetes was the strongest risk factor (adjusted odds ratio = 96.6, 95% confidence interval = 43.5-214.7). Among women without diabetes, periconceptional smoking was positively and significantly associated with sacral agenesis. Our findings underscore the importance of smoking cessation programs among women planning pregnancy and the importance of better understanding the role of glycemic control before and during pregnancy when designing interventions for primary prevention of sacral agenesis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31294918	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31294918	smoking	1116363438212354892

The information on prevalence of obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular risk (CVR) and on sociodemographic variables available in patients with psychiatric diseases about to be treated with weight gain-associated medication (e.g., clozapine, mirtazapine, quetiapine) is limited. In a naturalistic study, psychiatric inpatients (age: 18-75) of all F diagnoses according to ICD-10, who were about to be treated with weight gain-associated medication, were included. Demographic variables were assessed as well as biological parameters to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI), MetS, diabetes and CVR. A total of 163 inpatients were included (60.1% male; mean age: 39.8 (± 15.1, 18-75 years). The three most common disorders were depression (46.0%), bipolar disorder (20.9%) and drug addiction (20.2%). The three most common pharmacotherapeutic agents prescribed were quetiapine (29.4%), mirtazapine (20.9%) and risperidone (12.9%). Of the included inpatients 30.1% were overweight, 17.2% obese, and 26.9% and 22.4% fulfilled the criteria for a MetS according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the National Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (NCEP ATP III), respectively, 3.8% had (pre)diabetes and 8.3% had a moderate and 1.9% a high CVR according to the Prospective Cardiovascular Münster (PROCAM) score. Detailed information is reported on all assessed parameters as well as on subgroup analyses concerning sociodemographic variables. The results suggest that psychiatric patients suffer from multiple metabolic disturbances in comparison to the general population. Monitoring weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and cholesterol regularly is, therefore, highly relevant.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31302731	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302731	obesity	-9041546321432974047

Carotid artery disease which includes carotid artery stenosis, plaques, clots and increased intima media thickness, have been reported by many studies to be associated with dementia. Dementia is an end stage of usually asymptomatic cognitive impairment. Risk factors of carotid artery disease include; age, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, shorter years in school, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke and depression. This study set out to determine the prevalence of abnormal carotid ultrasound findings and their association with cognitive function among the adults ≥60 years in Wakiso district, Uganda in 2018. A total of 210 participants were included. Carotid artery stenosis, presence of plaque, stenosis and intima-media thickness were assessed by ultrasound. Cognitive status was assessed using a Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) test. The prevalence of plaque was 21.4%. Variables which included; presence of plaque, age, education, gender, marital status, whether participant stayed alone or with someone else, care for self, occupation status, division of staying and history of smoking. The presence of plaque was associated with an abnormal cognitive function at both univariate and multivariate analysis with respective OR = 3.8 (95% CI = 1.90-7.54, p-value = 0.0001) and OR = 3.4 (95% CI = 1.38-8.15, p-value = 0.007). The cognitive function distribution was 43.8%, 19%, 34.3% and 2.9% within the normal, mild, moderate, and severe cognitive function status respectively. This study showed that prevalence of carotid artery plaque was high in this elderly population in Wakiso district Uganda. Also, carotid artery plaque was associated with abnormal cognitive function.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Scotland	31301929	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301929	smoking	-1839591250599587429

Primary prophylaxis against variceal bleeding is indicated for patients with high-risk varices. In order for these patients to be identified, endoscopic screening for esophageal varices has been traditionally recommended at the time of the diagnosis of cirrhosis. Considering that many patients do not have esophageal varices in the early stages of cirrhosis and, therefore, are submitted to endoscopy unnecessarily, non-invasive methods for variceal screening have been studied. Among these non-invasive methods, the most extensively studied probably are platelet count/spleen diameter ratio, liver stiffness, spleen stiffness and an association between liver stiffness and platelet count, referred to as the Baveno VI criteria. The Baveno VI criteria has recently been recommended by different medical associations for variceal screening. This is a critical review on the non-invasive methods for variceal screening, in which the performances of the different methods are presented and the limitations of the existing evidence is discussed. Despite reasonable performances of some of these methods, especially platelet count/spleen diameter ratio and the association between liver stiffness and platelet count, we understand that the available evidence still has relevant limitations and that physicians should decide on screening cirrhotic patients for esophageal varices with endoscopy or non-invasive methods on a case-by-case basis.	2019	eng	Review	Mexico	31279653	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31279653	Cirrhosis	-8194774279664546436

The QuantiFERON®-TB Gold (QFT) stimulation platform for cytokine release is a novel approach for diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis in wildlife species. Plasma interferon gamma (IFN-γ) is routinely measured to detect immune sensitization to Mycobacterium bovis. However, the cytokine interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) has been proposed as an alternative, more sensitive, diagnostic biomarker. In this study, we investigated the use of the QFT system with measurement of IFN-γ and IP-10 in parallel to identify M. bovis-infected African buffaloes. The test results of either biomarker in a cohort of M. bovis-unexposed buffaloes (n = 70) led to calculation of 100% test specificity. Furthermore, in cohorts of M. bovis culture-positive (n = 51) and M. bovis-suspect (n = 22) buffaloes, the IP-10 test results were positive in a greater number of animals than the number based on the IFN-γ test results. Most notably, when the biomarkers were measured in parallel, the tests identified all M. bovis culture-positive buffaloes, a result neither the single comparative intradermal tuberculin test (SCITT) nor Bovigam® IFN-γ release assay (IGRA) achieved, individually or in parallel. These findings demonstrate the diagnostic potential of this blood-based assay to identify M. bovis-infected African buffaloes and a strategy to maximise the detection of infected animals while maintaining diagnostic specificity and simplifying test procedures.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31311648	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311648	tuberculosis	6309804346176212907

462	462	158	Journal of central nervous system disease	Targeting the Blood-Brain Barrier to Prevent Sepsis-Associated Cognitive Impairment.	Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory disease resulting from an infection. This disorder affects 750 000 people annually in the United States and has a 62% rehospitalization rate. Septic symptoms range from typical flu-like symptoms (eg, headache, fever) to a multifactorial syndrome known as sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). Patients with SAE exhibit an acute altered mental status and often have higher mortality and morbidity. In addition, many sepsis survivors are also burdened with long-term cognitive impairment. The mechanisms through which sepsis initiates SAE and promotes long-term cognitive impairment in septic survivors are poorly understood. Due to its unique role as an interface between the brain and the periphery, numerous studies support a regulatory role for the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the progression of acute and chronic brain dysfunction. In this review, we discuss the current body of literature which supports the BBB as a nexus which integrates signals from the brain and the periphery in sepsis. We highlight key insights on the mechanisms that contribute to the BBB's role in sepsis which include neuroinflammation, increased barrier permeability, immune cell infiltration, mitochondrial dysfunction, and a potential barrier role for tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). Finally, we address current drug treatments (eg, antimicrobials and intravenous immunoglobulins) for sepsis and their potential outcomes on brain function. A comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms may enable clinicians to target specific aspects of BBB function as a therapeutic tool to limit long-term cognitive impairment in sepsis survivors.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31007531	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007531	flu	4804093434821394840

In an endemic zone of tuberculosis (TB), osseous involvement is a relatively common presentation. Spine and long bones are the the most common nidus of TB. Smaller bones and joints are relatively less involved. Thorough clinical examination and history of typical constitutional symptoms like weight loss, fever and loss of appetite are the diagnostic aids for initiating early treatment. Wrist and hand involvement is a rare occurrence and often presents atypically without any obvious symptoms or signs. This results in delayed diagnosis and worse outcome. TB of lunate without articular involvement is a very rare subset and we present such an isolated case of TB involving the lunate, without any typical symptoms, with the patient complaining of vague pain without any restriction of joint mobility.

The incidence of cancer-associated non-traumatic spinal cord dysfunction is rising due to population aging and better cancer treatment. The overall benefit of rehabilitation in specialized facilities for traumatic spinal cord dysfunction has been confirmed many times. Because of their fragility and multiple comorbidities cancer patients still face challenges to complete rehabilitation in the spinal rehabilitation facilities. In this narrative review we describe specific aspects, challenges in rehabilitation and opportunities to improve care. A literature search was performed in the PubMed database from 1 January 1978 to 30 November 2018. The focus was to find publications that discuss challenges and opportunities for rehabilitation of patients with non-traumatic spinal cord dysfunction due to a tumor. Most publications described the benefits of rehabilitation in specialized facilities. There were only few publications about survival and functional outcomes after rehabilitation for this patient population. Overall benefits including fewer complications associated with spinal cord dysfunction, less pain and depression, and better quality of life were shown. Within the past decades increasing number of publications revealed a growing interest for this group of patients. Despite major progress in cancer treatment, patients still have a limited vital prognosis and access to specialized rehabilitation units because of the concerns about the medical complexity. Patients with spinal cord tumors can benefit in areas of functionality, mood, quality of life, and survival from inpatient rehabilitation programs, in spite of the increased medical comorbidities.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Austria	31312916	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312916	depression	207910079054861295

Despite advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a significant issue in the United States. Early diagnosis, continuous treatment access/adherence, and long-term care engagement help patients benefit fully from ART; however, a shortfall in care engagement remains, potentially leading to poorer health outcomes. This analysis benchmarks rates of health care quality and process measures to identify areas for improvement. This retrospective, claims-based, real-world cohort study assessed the percentage of prevalent (existing) and incident (newly diagnosed) patients with HIV with commercial or public health insurance meeting 4 National Quality Forum (NQF)-endorsed, 1 Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA), and 3 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) measures over a 4-year period. Most prevalent patients consistently met the NQF-endorsed prescribed ART and gaps in visits measures. Longer-term visit frequency measure rates were well below the 90% Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS target. Proportion of prevalent patients meeting each NQF-endorsed measure was maintained/increased with increasing age in 2015-2016. Substantially fewer incident patients than prevalent patients met NQF-endorsed measures across all measurement periods, particularly for visit frequency (32%-51%). PQA ART adherence was low (36%-73%). CDC receipt of care rates were high (83%-92%), whereas retention in care rates were low (67%-72%) among prevalent patients. For incident patients, linkage to care rates were consistently low (21%-44%). This study benchmarks current US HIV care engagement and highlights the need for improvement in early care engagement, ART adherence and long-term retention of care among patients with HIV.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31305206	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305206	HIV	-9076501258717815738

480	480	136	Neuroendocrinology	Intracranial germinoma masquerading as secondary granulomatous hypophysitis: A case report and review of literature.	Germinomas are highly immunogenic tumors eliciting a strong peri-tumoral immune response that can spillover into the surrounding healthy tissues. This phenomenon can also occur in intracranial germinomas, manifesting as secondary hypophysitis. Herein, we report a case of 12-year-old-girl presenting with polyuria and polydispsia. She had central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and panhypopituitarism. Imaging revealed a sellar-suprasellar mass with infundibular stalk thickening. Transphenoidal biopsy revealed epitheloid granulomas with immunostaining negative for germinomatous cells. Other causes of hypophysitis were ruled out. Accordingly, she was diagnosed as primary granulomatous hypophysitis and treated with high-dose corticosteroids. Three years later she again presented with headache, vomiting and diminution of vision. Imaging showed a heterogeneous, solid-cystic peripheral rim-enhancing lesion at the same location with involvement of hypothalamus, ependyma and pineal gland. Cerebrospinal fluid β-hCG was markedly elevated, confirming the diagnosis of an intracranial germ cell tumor. She was started on chemotherapy, however, she succumbed to febrile neutropenia. We performed a literature search and found 18 anecdotal cases of secondary hypophysitis associated with intracranial germinomas. There was a slight male preponderance (male:female 5:4). Two-third of the cases were below 18 years of age. Polyuria was the most common presenting manifestation (83%). CDI and panhypopituitarism were seen in 89% and 78% cases, respectively. Imaging evidence of pituitary stalk thickening was seen in 12 cases (67%) while pituitary enlargement and/or sellar mass was reported in 11 cases (61%). Pineal involvement was extremely rare, being reported in only 1 case, implying the predilection of suprasellar (rather than pineal) germinomas in causing secondary hypophysitis. Histologically, 82% had lymphocytic hypophysistis while 18% had granulomatous hypophysitis. Initially, the diagnosis of germinoma was missed in 60% of the cases who were wrongly treated with corticosteroids. To conclude, physicians should make it a dictum that all children and adolescents presenting with CDI and pituitary stalk thickening should be rigorously screened for an underlying intracranial germinoma before labelling them as primary hypophysitis.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31269501	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31269501	headache	4307023751244532288

Cardiometabolic affections greatly contribute to the global burden of disease. The susceptibility to obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes, conditions that add to the cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS), was associated with the ancestral genetic composition and gut microbiota. Studies explicitly testing associations between genetic ancestry and gut microbes are growing. We here examined whether the host genetic ancestry was associated with gut microbiota composition, and distinguished the effects of genetic ancestry and non-genetic factors on human cardiometabolic health. We performed a cross-sectional study with 441 community-dwelling Colombian mestizos from five cities spanning the Andes, Pacific, and Caribbean coasts. We characterized the host genetic ancestry by genotyping 40 ancestry informative markers; characterized gut microbiota through 16S rRNA gene sequencing; assessed diet intake, physical activity, cigarette, and medicament consumption; and measured cardiometabolic outcomes that allowed calculating a CMS risk scale. On average, each individual of our cohort was 67 ± 6% European, 21 ± 5% Native American and 12 ± 5% African. Multivariable-adjusted generalized linear models showed that individuals with higher Native American and African ancestries had increased fasting insulin, body mass index and CMS risk, as assessed by the CMS risk scale. Furthermore, we identified 21 OTUs associated to the host genetic ancestry and 20 to cardiometabolic health. While we highlight novel associations between genetic ancestry and gut microbiota, we found that the effect of intestinal microbes was more likely to explain the variance in CMS risk scale than the contributions of European, Native American and African genetic backgrounds.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31311405	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311405	obesity	-8311338126170554747
483	483	364	Cells	Advanced Molecular Knowledge of Therapeutic Drugs and Natural Products Focusing on Inflammatory Cytokines in Asthma.	Asthma is a common respiratory disease worldwide. Cytokines play a crucial role in the immune system and the inflammatory response to asthma. Abnormal cytokine expression may lead to the development of asthma, which may contribute to pathologies of this disease. As cytokines exhibit pleiotropy and redundancy characteristics, we summarized them according to their biologic activity in asthma development. We classified cytokines in three stages as follows: Group 1 cytokines for the epithelial environment stage, Group 2 cytokines for the Th2 polarization stage, and Group 3 cytokines for the tissue damage stage. The recent cytokine-targeting therapy for clinical use (anti-cytokine antibody/anti-cytokine receptor antibody) and traditional medicinal herbs (pure compounds, single herb, or natural formula) have been discussed in this review. Studies of the Group 2 anti-cytokine/anti-cytokine receptor therapies are more prominent than the studies of the other two groups. Anti-cytokine antibodies/anti-cytokine receptor antibodies for clinical use can be applied for patients who did not respond to standard treatments. For traditional medicinal herbs, anti-asthmatic bioactive compounds derived from medicinal herbs can be divided into five classes: alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, polyphenols, and terpenoids. However, the exact pathways targeted by these natural compounds need to be clarified. Using relevant knowledge to develop more comprehensive strategies may provide appropriate treatment for patients with asthma in the future.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31284537	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284537	asthma	-389749390447363927

Baloxavir marboxil is a newly approved antiviral agent with activity against influenza via a novel mechanism of action of inhibition of cap-dependent endonuclease (CEN). The novel agent was approved in October of 2018 in the United States for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza A and B in patients aged 12 years or older. Baloxavir is given as a single weight-based dose of 40 mg orally once for patients weighing less than 80 kg and 80 mg orally once for those weighing 80 kg or more within 48 hours of symptom onset. In comparison with current therapy, baloxavir is as effective in decreasing time to symptom alleviation as the drug of choice, oseltamivir, and significantly reduces viral load 1 day after treatment compared with placebo and oseltamivir. In safety analyses baloxavir was well tolerated with only mild adverse events reported (nausea, headache, diarrhea, bronchitis, nasopharyngitis), thus providing a safe and reliable alternative option to current therapy for acute uncomplicated influenza. Further studies are being conducted to evaluate the use of baloxavir in additional patient populations including pediatric patients less than 12 years of age and patients who are at high risk of complications related to influenza.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Spain	31250840	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250840	headache	-2667874153709252756

487	487	216	Plant, cell & environment	The flip side of phospho-signaling: regulation of protein dephosphorylation and the protein phosphatase 2Cs.	Protein phosphorylation is a key signaling mechanism and has myriad effects on protein function. Phosphorylation by protein kinases can be reversed by protein phosphatases, thus allowing dynamic control of protein phosphorylation. While this may suggest a straightforward kinase-phosphatase relationship, plant genomes contain five times more kinases than phosphatases. Here we examine phospho-signaling from a protein phosphatase centered perspective and ask how relatively few phosphatases regulate many phosphorylation sites. The most abundant class of plant phosphatases, the Protein Phosphatase 2Cs (PP2Cs), are surrounded by a web of regulation including inhibitor and activator proteins as well as post-translational modifications that regulate phosphatase activity, control phosphatase stability, or determine the subcellular locations where the phosphatase is present and active. These mechanisms are best established for the Clade A PP2Cs which are key components of stress and Abscisic Acid (ABA) signaling. We also describe other PP2C Clades and illustrate how these phosphatases are highly regulated and involved in a wide range of physiological functions. Together, these examples of multiple layers of phosphatase regulation help explain the unbalanced kinase-phosphatase ratio. Continued use of phosphoproteomics to examine phosphatase targets and phosphatase-kinase relationships will be important for deeper understanding of phosphoproteome regulation.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31314921	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314921	stress	-3653998742295730637

Analysis of vasopressin receptor type II (V2R) is essential to understand the physiology of water balance and it is used as a biological prototype of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (NSIAD) is a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) with low plasmatic vasopressin. The evidence on the role of V2 receptor and of aquaporin (AQP) in the mechanism of action for antidiuretic hormone (ADH) was based on the identification of protein gene mutations in patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and NSIAD syndrome. V2R activating mutations were found in patients with NSIAD, contrasting with the numerous V2R inactivating mutations related to X-linked mutations described in patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.	2019	fre	Review	Uganda	31312322	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312322	diabetes	186710613029854965

It can affect all mammals including humans. Dogs are the main source of human rabies deaths, contributing up to 99% of all rabies transmissions to humans. Vaccination against rabies is still the sole efficient way to fight against the disease. Cell culture vaccines are recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) for pre and post exposure prophylaxis; among them Vero cell rabies vaccines which are used worldwide. In this work we studied the purification of inactivated rabies virus produced in Vero cells grown in animal component free conditions, using different methods. Cells were grown in VP-SFM medium in stirred bioreactor, then infected at an MOI of 0.05 with the LP2061 rabies virus strain. Collected harvests were purified by zonal centrifugation, and by chromatography supports, namely the Capto Core 700 and the monolithic CIM-QA column. Generated data were compared in terms of residual DNA level, host cell proteins (HCP) level and the overall recovery yield. Rabies virus purification using the monolithic column resulted in the highest antigen recovery yield, equal to 94%. Capto Core 700 showed a lower yield, about 84%; whereas the purification yield by zonal centrifugation was equal to 60%. In terms of host cell residual DNA removal, zonal centrifugation was the most efficient method; the removal yield was equal to 88.5%; elimination of host cell DNA was slightly lower when using the monolithic CIM-QA (equal to 73%). Whereas Capto Core 700 showed the lowest level (49.2%). Host cell protein removal varied between 92.6% for the monolithic column and 78.6% for the zonal centrifugation.

We investigated the immunogenicity and cross protective efficacy of virus-like particle containing neuraminidase derived from 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus (N1 VLP) in comparison with inactivated split influenza vaccine. Immunization of mice with N1 VLP induced antibody responses specific for virus and cross-reactive neuraminidase inhibition activity whereas an inactivated split vaccine induced strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition activity. N1 VLP-immunized mice developed cross protective immunity against antigenically different influenza viruses, as determined by body weight changes, lung viral titers, infiltrating innate immune cells, and cytokines, and antibody secreting cells, and germinal center B cells. Also, N1 VLP-immune sera provided cross-protection in naïve mice. Immunity by N1 VLP vaccination was not compromised in Fc receptor γ-chain deficient mice.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no cure. While there are many hypotheses, the exact mechanism causing this pathology is still unknown. Among many other features, AD is characterized by brain hypometabolism and decreased sugar availability, to which neurons eventually succumb. In light of this aspect of the disease, we hypothesized that boosting fuel supply to neurons may help them survive or at least alleviate some of the symptoms. Here we demonstrate that live moss Physcomitrella patens cells can be safely co-cultured with human fibroblasts in vitro and thus have a potential for providing human cells with energy and other vital biomolecules. These data may form the foundation for the development of novel approaches to metabolic bioengineering and treatment of diseased cells based on live plants. In addition, by providing alternative energy sources to human tissues, the biotechnological potential of this interkingdom setup could also serve as a springboard to foster innovative dietary processes addressing current challenges of mankind such as famine or supporting long-haul space flight.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31177231	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31177231	Alzheimer	1485652648052127324

Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) of atrial fibrillation (AF) can reduce the AF burden and, potentially, reduce the long-term risk of strokes and death. However, it remains unclear whether anticoagulants can be stopped after PVI because of post-ablation AF recurrence in some patients. This study aimed to investigate the discontinuation rate of anticoagulants and long-term incidence of strokes after PVI.We enrolled 512 consecutive Japanese patients with AF (mean age, 63.4 ± 10.4 years; 123 women; 234 with non-paroxysmal AF; CHADS2 score/CHA2DS2-VASC score, 1.32 ± 1.12/2.21 ± 1.54) who underwent PVI between 2012 and 2015. During a 28.0 ± 17.1 -month follow-up, anticoagulants were terminated in 230 (44.9%) of the 512 patients, AF recurred in 200 (39.1%), and 10 (1.95%) suffered from a stroke. Death occurred in 5 (0.98%) patients. Although the incidence of strokes, by a Kaplan-Meier analysis, was similar, the incidence of death was lower (Hazard ratio 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.93, P = 0.041) in the AF ablation group than the control group without ablation after 1:1 propensity score matching (the control data was derived from 2,986 patients in the SAKURA AF Registry, a large-cohort AF registry).Anticoagulants were discontinued in nearly half the patients who underwent AF ablation; of these, 39.1% experienced AF recurrences, 1.95% suffered from strokes, and 0.98% died, but the risk of death after AF ablation appeared to be lower than that in a propensity score-matched control group without ablation during long-term follow-up.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Japan	31308323	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308323	stroke	-5781461435447152359

Left ventricular (LV) adaptation to aging is currently poorly understood. We aimed to characterize age related changes in LV structure and function by studying a large group of healthy subjects across a wide age range. Prospectively enrolled healthy volunteers (n = 778, 327 females; age 18 to 100 years, mean age 49.8 ± 18.1 years), were divided into 4 age groups: 18 to 34 years (n = 165); 35 to 49 years (n = 242), 50 to 79 years (n = 334) and ≥ 80 years (n = 40). All subjects underwent clinical examination, as well as comprehensive transthoracic echocardiogram [TTE]. Body mass index, systolic blood pressure (BP), and left atrial volume (p < 0.0001) increased with age while diastolic BP (p < 0.0001) decreased over time. LV mass/body surface area (BSA) and relative wall thickness increased with age (p < 0.0001) coincident with worsening parameters of diastolic function (E/A and E/Em, p < 0.0001). The ejection fraction and Sm did not change significantly. Stroke volume, ejection time index, flow rate and stroke work significantly increased with age (p < 0.01). The arterial elastance (Ea), a measure of ventricular afterload, and ventricular elastance (Ees), an index of LV systolic stiffness did not change with age nor did their ratio (Ees/Ea) the latter being an expression of ventricular-arterial coupling. Age, gender and LVM were the main independent variables associated with LV systolic function. In conclusion, LV adaptation to aging in a healthy cohort is characterized by concentric LV remodeling, increased contractility and preserved ventricular-arterial coupling.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31297672	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297672	aging	-8340365043226490059

519	519	399	Toxicology letters	Functions of thioredoxin1 in brain development and in response to environmental chemicals in zebrafish embryos.	Thioredoxin is an evolutionarily conserved antioxidant protein that plays a crucial role for fundamental cellular processes and embryonic development. Growing evidence support that Thioredoxin influences cellular response to chemicals insults, particularly those accompanying oxidative stress. The mechanisms underlying the functions of Thioredoxin1 in the embryonic development under the environmental toxicant exposure remain, however, largely unexplored. We report here that thioredoxin1 becomes differentially expressed in zebrafish embryos after exposure to 9 out of 11 environmental chemicals. In situ gene expression analysis show that thioredoxin1 is expressed in neurons, olfactory epithelia, liver and swim bladder under normal conditions. After MeHg exposure, however, thioredoxin1 is ectopically induced in the hair cells of the lateral line and in epithelia cells of the pharynx. Knockdown of Thioredoxin1 induces hydrocephalus and increases cell apoptosis in the brain ventricular epithelia cells. In comparison with 5% malformation in embryos injected with control morpholino, MeHg induces more than 77% defects in Thioredoxin1 knockdown embryos. Our data suggest that there is an association between hydrocephalus and Thioredoxin1 malfunction in embryonic development, and provide valuable information to elucidate the protective role of Thioredoxin1 against chemicals disruption.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31310794	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310794	stress	756136904399885845

In the first half of the twentieth century, the rate of death from infectious disease in the United States fell precipitously. Although this decline is well-known and well-documented, there is surprisingly little evidence about whether it took place uniformly across the regions of the United States. We use data on infectious disease deaths from all reporting U.S. cities to describe regional patterns in the decline of urban infectious mortality from 1900 to 1948. We report three main results. First, urban infectious mortality was higher in the South in every year from 1900 to 1948. Second, infectious mortality declined later in southern cities than in cities in the other regions. Third, comparatively high infectious mortality in southern cities was driven primarily by extremely high infectious mortality among African Americans. From 1906 to 1920, African Americans in cities experienced a rate of death from infectious disease that was greater than what urban whites experienced during the 1918 flu pandemic.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31197611	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31197611	flu	1400543852157442197

The success of immunotherapy has led to a myriad of clinical trials accompanied by efforts to gain mechanistic insight and identify predictive signatures for personalization. However, many immune monitoring technologies face investigator bias, missing unanticipated cellular responses in limited clinical material. We present here a mass cytometry (CyTOF) workflow for standardized, systems-level biomarker discovery in immunotherapy trials. To broadly enumerate immune cell identity and activity, we established and extensively assessed a reference panel of 33 antibodies to cover major cell subsets, simultaneously quantifying activation and immune checkpoint molecules in a single assay. This assay enumerates ≥98% of peripheral immune cells with ≥4 positively identifying antigens. Robustness and reproducibility are demonstrated on multiple samples types, across two research centers and by orthogonal measurements. Using automated analysis, we identify stratifying immune signatures in bone marrow transplantation-associated graft-versus-host disease. Together, this validated workflow ensures comprehensive immunophenotypic analysis and data comparability and will accelerate biomarker discovery.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31315057	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315057	cancer	2415534163825594672

We investigated the incidence of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among people with COPD and whether exposure to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and exacerbation status was associated with T2DM. This descriptive cohort study used primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The patient cohort included people with a diagnosis of COPD and previous smoking history registered at a CPRD practice between January 2010 and December 2016. We determined incidence rates by age, gender and deprivation. Using a nested case-control design-where cases and controls are drawn from the cohort population-we matched 1:5 with patients by age, gender and GP practice and estimated odds of T2DM using logistic regression (adjusting for smoking status, deprivation, BMI, hypertension, coronary heart disease and heart failure). We identified 220,971 COPD patients; mean age at COPD diagnosis was 66 years (SD 12) and 54% were male. The incidence rate of T2DM in COPD patients was 1.26 per 100 patient years (95% CI: 1.24-1.28) and was higher among men (1.32 vs 1.18 among women). The adjusted odds ratio for T2DM was 1.47 (95% CI: 1.36-1.60) among frequent exacerbators (≥2 treated exacerbations per year) compared to infrequent exacerbators and the odds ratio for patients receiving high-dose ICS (>800 mcg budesonide equivalent dose) was 1.73 (95% CI 1.65-1.82) compared to patients receiving no ICS therapy. Incidence of T2DM among COPD patients is high and exposure to ICS and frequent exacerbations are associated with a higher risk of T2DM among patients with COPD.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31308364	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308364	diabetes	5462702203586546682

A paradigm shifting study demonstrated that induction of MHC class E and II-restricted CD8+ T cells was associated with the clearance of SIV infection in rhesus macaques. Another recent study highlighted the presence of HIV-1-specific class II-restricted CD8+ T cells in HIV-1 patients who naturally control infection (virus controllers; VCs). However, questions regarding class II-restricted CD8+ T cells ontogeny, distribution across different HIV-1 disease states and their role in viral control remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the distribution and anti-viral properties of HLA-DRB1*0701 and DQB1*0501 class II-restricted CD8+ T cells in different HIV-1 patient cohorts; and whether class II-restricted CD8+ T cells represent a unique T cell subset. We show that memory class II-restricted CD8+ T cell responses were more often detectable in VCs than in chronically infected patients, but not in healthy seronegative donors. We also demonstrate that VC CD8+ T cells inhibit virus replication in both a class I- and class II-dependent manner, and that in two VC patients the class II-restricted CD8+ T cells with an anti-viral gene signature expressed both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell lineage-specific genes. These data demonstrated that anti-viral memory class II-restricted CD8+ T cells with hybrid CD4+ and CD8+ features are present during natural HIV-1 infection.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31308388	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308388	HIV	-1730766821655383888

Co-infection with hepatitis B and C among HIV infected patients are prevalent among high-risk populations. This meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of HIV, HCV and HBV co-infections among high-risk populations in Iran. We systematically searched the national and international electronic databases until 2016. The primary outcome was the prevalence of HIV, HBV, HCV and HIV co-infections in different high-risk populations in Iran. All English and Persian studies conducted on Iranian high-risk groups were included in the study. The review was reported based on PRISMA guidelines and data were analysed at 95% confidence level using random effect models. Overall, 916 relevant papers were recognised and 14 articles were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimates of HBV/HCV, HCV/HIV, HBV/HIV and HBV/HCV/HIV were 1.3% (95%CI: 0.5-2.1), 16.3% (95%CI: 1.1-31.6), 0.5% (95%CI: 0-1.4) and 0.5% (95%CI: 0.2-0.8), respectively. Based on subgroup analysis, there was a higher proportion of all co-infections from the years 2010-2016 as compared to that of the years 2003-2009. Our results highlighted that HCV/HIV co-infection in Iranian high-risk groups including injection drug users (IDUs) and prisoners is common.

An ortho ester-linked indomethacin (IND) dimer-based nanodrug delivery system was prepared to improve the therapeutic effect of doxorubicin (DOX) by reversing the multidrug resistance. The synthesized dimer (IND-OE) could form stable nanoparticles (IND-OE/DOX) loaded with DOX via single emulsion method. Compare to non-sensitive nanoparticles (IND-C12/DOX), IND-OE/DOX showed a rapid degradation behavior and accelerated drug release at mildly acidic environments. In vitro cell experiments verified that IND-OE nanoparticles could increase DOX concentration due to the efficient intracellular drug release by the degradation of ortho ester as well as reduced DOX efflux by IND-mediated P-gp down-regulating. In vivo studies further demonstrated that IND-OE/DOX displayed the maximized synergetic antitumor efficacy than free DOX or IND-C12/DOX, and the tumor inhibition rate versus saline was 46.78% (free DOX), 60.23% (IND-C12/DOX), and 80.62% (IND-OE/DOX), respectively. Overall, this strategy of combination with chemosensitizers and ortho ester linkage has great potentials to serve as an amplifying chemotherapy platform against various drug-resistant tumors.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31314480	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314480	cancer	5163772683749067995

544	544	443	The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience	Circular RNA TLK1 aggravates neuronal injury and neurological deficits after ischemic stroke via miR-335-3p/TIPARP.	Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are expressed at high levels in the brain and are involved in various central nervous system diseases. However, the potential role of circRNAs in ischemic stroke-associated neuronal injury remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the important functions of circRNA TLK1 (circTLK1) in this process. The levels of circTLK1 were significantly increased in brain tissues in a mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Knockdown of circTLK1 significantly decreased infarct volumes, attenuated neuronal injury, and improved neurological deficits. Furthermore, circTLK1 functioned as an endogenous miR-335-3p sponge to inhibit miR-335-3p activity, resulting in the increase of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-inducible poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase expression and a subsequent exacerbation of neuronal injury. Clinical studies confirmed increased levels of circTLK1 in the plasma of patients with acute ischemic stroke (59 males and 12 females). Our findings reveal a detrimental role of circTLK1 in ischemic brain injury.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31311824	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311824	stroke	8587620342631480154
545	545	517	Handbook of clinical neurology	Clinical neurophysiology of stroke.	Stroke constitutes the third most common cause of death and the leading cause of acquired neurologic handicap. During ischemic stroke, very early after the onset of the focal perfusion deficit, excitotoxicity triggers a number of events that can further contribute to tissue death. Such events include peri-infarct depolarizations and spreading depolarizations (SDs) within the ischemic penumbra. SDs spread slowly through continuous gray matter at a typical velocity of 2-5mm/min. SDs exacerbate neuronal injury through prolonged ionic breakdown and SD-related hypoperfusion (spreading ischemia). Scalp EEG alone is not yet sufficient to reliably diagnose SDs. Hyperexcitability occurs in parallel, both in the acute and chronic phases of stroke. Stroke is a common cause of new-onset epileptic seizures after middle age and is the leading cause of symptomatic epilepsy in adults. The last part of this chapter is dedicated to noninvasive neurophysiologic techniques that can be used to promote stroke rehabilitation. These techniques mainly include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and tDCS. These approaches are based on the concept of interhemispheric rivalry and aim at modulating the imbalance of cortical activities between both hemispheres resulting from stroke.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31307595	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307595	stroke	2910288655685129221

547	547	557	Psychiatry research	Polygenic liability for schizophrenia predicts shifting-specific executive function deficits and tobacco use in a moderate drinking community sample.	Individuals with schizophrenia have higher lifetime rates of substance use disorders than the general population, and research suggests high comorbidity rates may be partially explained by shared genetic influences related to common underlying etiology. Moreover, deficits in executive functions are thought to be central to the diagnosis of schizophrenia and are likewise associated with alcohol and tobacco use. The current study examined the associations between schizophrenia polygenic risk scores and tobacco and alcohol use and the mediation of these associations by executive function sub-domains. Results from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium's meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of schizophrenia were used to calculate polygenic risk scores in a sample of moderate drinkers. Schizophrenia risk scores were significantly associated with shifting-specific executive function deficits and tobacco use phenotypes. However, risk scores were not significantly associated with alcohol use and executive functions were not significantly associated with either tobacco or alcohol use. These findings extend previous research by suggesting that genetic risk for schizophrenia may be associated with specific sub-domains of executive function as well as smoking. The lack of a relation with alcohol use suggests genetic factors related to schizophrenia and executive functioning may not influence drinking in a non-disordered, social-drinking sample.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Ireland	31299563	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299563	smoking	515531013045220470

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are unintentionally generated in foods that are cooked, and dietary ingestion of these PAHs is regarded as the dominant route of exposure to PAHs. Some chlorinated PAHs (ClPAHs) are more toxic than their corresponding parent PAHs and can also be generated in food during cooking. Knowledge of the concentrations of ClPAHs in cooked foods has been limited by the lack of an adequate analytical method for measuring ClPAH concentrations in cooked foods. In this study, we developed an analytical method for simultaneous determination of PAHs and ClPAHs in lipid-rich foods. The combination of a potassium hydroxide silica gel column and an activated carbon cartridge enabled us to simultaneously measure PAH and ClPAH concentrations in raw and grilled fish and meats. Twelve kinds of PAHs (e.g., fluorene [Fle], phenanthrene [Phe], fluoranthene [Flu], and pyrene [Pyr]) were detected in grilled foods.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), a type of bile duct cancer, has a high mortality rate. Gut microbiota, bile acid metabolism, and cytokines have not been characterized in patients with ICC, and better noninvasive diagnostic approaches for ICC are essential to be established. Accordingly, in this study, we aimed to improve our understanding of changes in gut microbiota, bile acid metabolism, and cytokines in patients with ICC. We found that the α- and β-diversities of ICC were highest and that the abundances of four genera (Lactobacillus, Actinomyces, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Alloscardovia) were increased in patients with ICC compared with those in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cirrhosis and in normal individuals. The glycoursodeoxycholic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) plasma-stool ratios (PSRs) were obviously increased in patients with ICC. Furthermore, the genera Lactobacillus and Alloscardovia positively correlated with TUDCA-PSR were combined to discriminate ICC from the other three diseases. Vascular invasion (VI) frequently led to a poor prognosis in patients with ICC. Compared with patients with ICC without VI, patients with VI had a greater abundance of the family Ruminococcaceae, increased levels of plasma interleukin (IL)-4 and six conjugated bile acids, and decreased levels of plasma IL-6 and chenodeoxycholic acid. A positive correlation between plasma taurocholic acid and IL-4 was observed in patients with ICC. Plasma TUDCA was negatively correlated with the abundance of the genus Pseudoramibacter and the survival time of patients with ICC, but had no effect on tumor size, as determined in two murine tumor models. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified new biomarkers, including gut microbiota, bile acids, and inflammatory cytokines, for diagnosis of ICC and prediction of VI in patients with ICC.

558	558	402	 	Diffuse Liver Disease: Cirrhosis, Focal Lesions in Cirrhosis, and Vascular Liver Disease	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease. If NAFLD and chronic viral hepatitis remain untreated, patients gradually develop liver fibrosis further progressing to cirrhosis. Significant advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR elastography allow quantification of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis before end-stage liver disease and emerge as noninvasive screening and monitoring tools as an alternative to liver biopsy (Dulai et al. J Hepatol. 65(5):1006–1016, 2016). Cirrhosis is characterized by progressive fibrosis of the liver parenchyma with ongoing regeneration. However, at an early stage of cirrhosis, the liver may appear normal. Patients with cirrhosis are not only at risk of liver failure but also at risk to develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma. HCC in cirrhosis either develops in a stepwise carcinogenesis from regenerative nodules to low-grade dysplastic nodule, high-grade dysplastic nodule, and HCC or develops de novo. To facilitate and standardize the categorization of these cirrhotic nodules seen in patients at risk for HCC along a spectrum from benign to malignant, the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) provides a diagnostic algorithm for analysis of cross-sectional images (Santillan et al. Magn Reson Imaging Clin N Am. 22(3):337–352, 2014). HCC differs from most malignancies because it is commonly diagnosed on the basis of imaging features alone, without histological confirmation. Vascular liver disease such as arterioportal shunts may be difficult to distinguish from HCC. Diffuse parenchymal alteration seen in Budd-Chiari syndrome with large hypervascular regenerative nodules can be mistaken for HCC. Portal vein thrombosis occurs in the setting of cirrhosis and HCC and either appears as bland thrombus or tumor thrombus.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314363	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314363	Cirrhosis	5238119115012015307

Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a high-occurrence neurological disorder but the difficulty in identifying precise and early biomarkers has complicated the understanding of the disease and the development of new treatments. In this sense, important knowledge is emerging regarding novel molecular and biological candidates with diagnostic potential, including microRNAs (miRNAs), which have a key role in gene repression. The aim of this systematic review was to define the role of miRNAs' expression as biomarkers for LOAD both in brain tissues, which could help understand the biology of the disease, and circulating tissues, which could serve as non-invasive markers of the pathology. A systematic search was performed in Web of Science and PubMed using the keywords ((Alzheimer or Alzheimer's) and (microRNA or microRNAs or miRNA or miRNAs or miR)) until August 2018 to retrieve all articles that presented independent original data evaluating the impact of miRNA expression on the development of LOAD in human population. A total of 90 studies investigating the role of miRNAs' expression in the development of LOAD were identified. While other widely studied miRNAs such as hsa-miR-146a presented contradictory results among studies, deregulation in brain tissue of seven miRNAs, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-107, hsa-miR-125-5p, hsa-miR-132-3p, hsa-miR-181-3p, and hsa-miR-212-3p, was consistently identified in LOAD patients. Their role in the disease could be mediated through the regulation of key pathways, such as axon guidance, longevity, insulin, and MAPK signaling pathway. However, regarding their role as non-invasive biomarkers of LOAD in fluids, although the limited results available are promising, further studies are required.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31240600	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31240600	Alzheimer	4668172927098913296

574	574	506	Oncology letters	Serum microRNA-125a-5p as a potential biomarker of HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma.	During diagnosis of early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), single or small lesions are difficult to identify using screening ultrasonography, and conventional tumor markers are frequently negative. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that suppress the translation of target mRNAs and exert significance as biomarkers. The aim of the present study was to use samples of patients with HCC and those with other liver diseases caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to investigate the expression profile of serum miRNAs, and identify a miRNA that can serve as a HCC biomarker. Initially, changes in 2,555 miRNAs between pre- and post-curative treatment serum from 12 patients with early stage HCC were examined using microarray analysis. The serum levels of miR-125a-5p in 40 individuals with HCV-associated chronic hepatitis (CH), liver cirrhosis (LC) or HCC were measured using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and 5 miRNAs, including miR-125a-5p, miR-423-5p, miR-1247, miR-1304 and miR-3648, were identified to be downregulated following curative treatment in patients with HCC. Among these, miR-125a-5p was identified to be similarly decreased following treatment in all patients. Additionally, the expression levels of miR-125a-5p were significantly upregulated in patients with HCC in the early and advanced stages of disease, compared with patients with CH or LC (P<0.05). Serum miR-125a-5p fluctuates depending on the presence of HCC, and may serve as a noninvasive biomarker to aid in diagnosing early carcinogenesis in HCV-associated chronic liver diseases.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Greece	31289566	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31289566	Cirrhosis	6989198691754522425
575	575	313	Endocrinology	Associations between bone impact microindentation and clinical risk factors for fracture.	Impact microindentation (IMI) measures bone material strength index (BMSi) in vivo. However, clinical risk factors that affect BMSi are largely unknown. This study investigated associations between BMSi and clinical risk factors for fracture in men. BMSi was measured using the OsteoProbe in 357 men (ages 33-96yr) from the Geelong Osteoporosis Study. Risk factors included age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), femoral neck BMD, parental hip fracture, prior fracture, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), secondary osteoporosis, smoking, alcohol consumption, sedentary lifestyle, medications, diseases and low serum vitamin D levels. BMSi was negatively associated with age (r = -0.131, p=0.014), weight (r = -0.109, p=0.040) and BMI (r = -0.083, p=0.001); no correlations were detected with BMD (r = 0.000, p=0.998) or height (r = 0.087, p=0.10). Mean BMSi values for men with and without prior fracture were 80.2±6.9 vs 82.8±6.1 (p=0.024); parental hip fracture 80.1±6.1 vs 82.8±6.9 (p=0.029); T2DM 80.3 ± 8.5 vs 82.9 ± 6.6 (p=0.059). BMSi did not differ in the presence vs absence of other risk factors. In multivariable models, mean(±SD) BMSi remained associated with prior fracture and parental hip fracture after adjusting for age and BMI: prior fracture (80.5±1.1 vs 82.8±0.4, p=0.044); parental fracture (79.9±1.2 vs 82.9±0.4, p=0.015). No other confounders were identified. We conclude that in men, BMSi discriminates prior fracture and parental hip fracture, which are both known to increase the risk for incident fracture. These findings suggest that IMI may be useful for identifying men who have an increased risk for fracture.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31310275	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310275	diabetes	7206850235815254159

580	580	63	Journal of neurovirology	Polymorphisms in CAMKK2 associate with susceptibility to sensory neuropathy in HIV patients treated without stavudine.	HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) is a debilitating neurological complication of HIV infection potentiated by the antiretroviral drug stavudine. While stavudine is no longer used, HIV-SN now affects around 15% of HIV+ Indonesians. Here, we investigate whether polymorphisms within the P2X-block (P2X4R, P2X7R, CAMKK2) and/or ANAPC5 mark susceptibility to HIV-SN in this setting. As polymorphisms in these genes associated with HIV-SN in African HIV patients receiving stavudine, the comparison can identify mechanisms independent of stavudine. HIV patients who had never used stavudine (n = 202) attending clinics in Jakarta were screened for neuropathy using the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Brief Peripheral Neuropathy Screen. Open-array technology was used to type 48 polymorphisms spanning the four genes. Haplotypes were derived for each gene using fastPHASE. Haplogroups were constructed with median-joining methods. Multivariable models optimally predicting HIV-SN were based on factors achieving p < 0.2 in bivariate analyses. Minor alleles of three co-inherited polymorphisms in CAMKK2 (rs7975295*C, rs1560568*A, rs1132780*T) associated with a reduced prevalence of HIV-SN individually and after adjusting for lower CD4 T cell count and viremia (p = 0.0002, pseudo R	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31309408	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309408	HIV	-23817016428727099

In 1918, a strain of influenza A virus caused a human pandemic resulting in the deaths of 50 million people. A century later, with the advent of sequencing technology and corresponding phylogenetic methods, we know much more about the origins, evolution and epidemiology of influenza epidemics. Here we review the history of avian influenza viruses through the lens of their genetic makeup: from their relationship to human pandemic viruses, starting with the 1918 H1N1 strain, through to the highly pathogenic epidemics in birds and zoonoses up to 2018. We describe the genesis of novel influenza A virus strains by reassortment and evolution in wild and domestic bird populations, as well as the role of wild bird migration in their long-range spread. The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, and the zoonotic incursions of avian H5 and H7 viruses into humans over the last couple of decades are also described. The threat of a new avian influenza virus causing a human pandemic is still present today, although control in domestic avian populations can minimize the risk to human health.

BACKGROUND Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), characterized by an increased intra-abdominal pressure and new-onset organ dysfunction, is a critical and potentially fatal condition, with no case of ACS caused by intestinal gas without intestinal lesion being reported to date. CASE REPORT A 2-year-old girl with a chromosomal abnormality of 1p36 deletion presented with fever and diarrhea following upper-gastrointestinal series for the evaluation of gastroesophageal reflux. After 20 days, she experienced septic shock and multiple-organ failure, accompanied with rapidly growing, severe abdominal distension. A marked increase in the intra-abdominal pressure was indicated by the complete loss of elasticity in the extremely hard and distended abdomen. She died 14 h after the onset of shock. Her autopsy examination revealed extensive pneumonia and excessive intestinal gas, despite no occlusive intestinal lesion present. CONCLUSIONS It is critical to be aware that secondary ACS can occur following sepsis due to the accumulation of extensive intestinal gas, without an occlusive intestinal lesion.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31300635	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300635	Diarrhea	4118743389464105405
583	583	403	Molecular and cellular endocrinology	Nicotine induces insulin resistance via downregulation of Nrf2 in cardiomyocyte.	Clinical studies have demonstrated that cigarette smoking is strongly associated with insulin resistance and heart disease. Nicotine is considered the primary toxin constituent associated with smoking. However, the distinct molecular mechanism of nicotine-induced cardiac dysfunction remains unclear. Cardiomyocytes with nicotine-induced insulin resistance are characterized by decreased glucose uptake, as measured by 2-[N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-NBDG), a fluorescent derivative of glucose, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Immunoblotting was used to evaluate the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K, p85, Y607). We determined the impact of nicotine on insulin resistance and Nrf2, phospho-ERK and phospho-PI3K expression in the myocardial tissue of a mouse model. Nicotine increased ROS production and depressed insulin-induced glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, reversed nicotine-inhibited glucose uptake induced by insulin. Nicotine exposure directly inhibited Nrf2 and increased ERK phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes, which were obstructed by NAC. Further exploration of signaling cascades revealed nicotine-induced ROS involved in inhibiting PI3K/Nrf2 and activating ERK in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, the mouse model treated with nicotine showed glucose intolerance and impaired insulin tolerance accompanied by inhibited PI3K/Nrf2 and increased ERK in myocardial tissues. Thus, nicotine induces insulin resistance via the downregulation of Nrf2 activity in cardiomyocytes, which is a potential mechanism of the pharmacological effects of nicotine. This study identified potential therapeutic targets against nicotine-related cardiovascular diseases.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Ireland	31315024	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315024	smoking	-8618420761918493321

Based on a self-developed triaxial seepage device, a new loading and unloading experimental method is proposed in this paper to eliminate sample variations. The results show that the strength of sandstone sample and the axial strain at failure increased with the increasing initial hydrostatic stress, but decreased with the increasing loading-unloading rate. Following the alternating loading-unloading test, the stress-strain curves of specimens advanced in wave form, the waves' volatility decreased and then increased. It is found that near the ultimate strength, volatility is the biggest, and the stability of waves' volatility increased along with the increasing initial hydrostatic stress. The similarity of stress-strain curves between the conventional loading-unloading tests and the alternating loading-unloading tests increased along with the increasing initial hydrostatic stress and the increasing initial velocity for the alternating loading-unloading method. Along with the increasing initial hydrostatic stress, the failure behaviour of the sandstone samples tested under loading-unloading methods changed from a tensile state to a tensile-shear coexisting state, and finally to a fully shear failure state. The degree of failure modes increased with the increasing loading-unloading rate.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31312477	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312477	stress	-4698104907897418459

Stem cell therapy is a promising treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases that mostly affect geriatric patients who often suffer from comorbidities requiring multiple medications. However, not much is known about the interactions between stem cells and drugs. Here, we focus on the potential interactions between drugs used to treat the comorbidities or sequelae of neurodegenerative diseases and neuronal stem cells to reveal potential effects on drug safety and efficacy. To determine the potential effects of drugs frequently used in geriatric patients (analgesic, antibiotic, antidepressant, antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic, and antihypertensive drugs) on neuronal stem cell differentiation and proliferation, we systematically searched PubMed to identify nonreview articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals between January 1, 1991, and June 7, 2018. We identified 5,954 publications, of which 214 were included. Only 62 publications provided the complete data sets required for meta-analysis. We found that antidepressants stimulated neuronal stem cell proliferation but not differentiation under physiologic conditions and increased the proliferation of stem cells in the context of stress. Several other potential interactions were identified, but the limited number of available data sets precludes robust conclusions. Although available data were in most cases insufficient to perform robust meta-analysis, a clear interaction between antidepressants and neuronal stem cells was identified. We reveal potential other interactions requiring further experimental investigation. We recommend that future research addresses such interactions and investigates the best combination of pharmacological interventions and neuronal stem cell treatments for more efficient and safer patient care.

The centrally coordinated response that controlled the polio epidemics of the 1950s through immunisation led to the development of a national immunisation strategy in the UK and the formation of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in 1963, which oversees the immunisation programme and advises the UK Department of Health on new vaccine introductions. As a result of technological advances in vaccine development and scientific advances in immunology and microbiology over the 56 years since then, and the formation of a comprehensive public health surveillance system for vaccine-preventable disease, the National Health Service immunisation programme now covers 18 serious diseases of childhood, with an astonishing impact on child health.

596	596	758	PLoS biology	ADAMTS13 maintains cerebrovascular integrity to ameliorate Alzheimer-like pathology.	Blood-brain barrier (BBB) defects and cerebrovascular dysfunction contribute to amyloid-β (Aβ) brain accumulation and drive Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. By regulating vascular functions and inflammation in the microvasculature, a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type I motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13) plays a significant protective effect in atherosclerosis and stroke. However, whether ADAMTS13 influences AD pathogenesis remains unclear. Using in vivo multiphoton microscopy, histological, behavioral, and biological methods, we determined BBB integrity, cerebrovascular dysfunction, amyloid accumulation, and cognitive impairment in APPPS1 mice lacking ADAMTS13. We also tested the impact of viral-mediated expression of ADAMTS13 on cerebrovascular function and AD-like pathology in APPPS1 mice. We show that ADAMTS13 deficiency led to an early and progressive BBB breakdown as well as reductions in vessel density, capillary perfusion, and cerebral blood flow in APPPS1 mice. We found that deficiency of ADAMTS13 increased brain plaque load and Aβ levels and accelerated cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) by impeding BBB-mediated clearance of brain Aβ, resulting in worse cognitive decline in APPPS1 mice. Virus-mediated expression of ADAMTS13 attenuated BBB disruption and increased microvessels, capillary perfusion, and cerebral blood flow in APPPS1 mice already showing BBB damage and plaque deposition. These beneficial vascular effects were reflected by increase in clearance of cerebral Aβ, reductions in Aβ brain accumulation, and improvements in cognitive performance. Our results show that ADAMTS13 deficiency contributes to AD cerebrovascular dysfunction and the resulting pathogenesis and cognitive deficits and suggest that ADAMTS13 may offer novel therapeutic opportunities for AD.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31185010	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31185010	Alzheimer	4548329563501022787

"In recent years various EU/EEA countries have experienced an influx of migrants from low and middle-income countries. In 2018, the ""Vaccine European New Integrated Collaboration Effort (VENICE)"" survey group conducted a survey among 30 EU/EEA countries to investigate immunisation policies and practices targeting irregular migrants, refugees and asylum seekers (later called ""migrants"" in this report). Twenty-nine countries participated in the survey. Twenty-eight countries reported having national policies targeting children/adolescent and adult migrants, however vaccinations offered to adult migrants are limited to specific conditions in seven countries. All the vaccinations included in the National Immunisation Programme (NIP) are offered to children/adolescents in 27/28 countries and to adults in 13/28 countries. In the 15 countries offering only certain vaccinations to adults, priority is given to diphtheria-tetanus, measles-mumps-rubella and polio vaccinations. Information about the vaccines given to child/adolescent migrants is recorded in 22 countries and to adult migrants in 19 countries with a large variation in recording methods found across countries. Individual and aggregated data are reportedly not shared with other centres/institutions in 13 and 15 countries, respectively. Twenty countries reported not collecting data on vaccination uptake among migrants; only three countries have these data at the national level. Procedures to guarantee migrants' access to vaccinations at the community level are available in 13 countries. In conclusion, although diversified, strategies for migrant vaccination are in place in all countries except for one, and the strategies are generally in line with international recommendations. Efforts are needed to strengthen partnerships and implement initiatives across countries of origin, transit and destination to develop and better share documentation in order to guarantee a completion of vaccination series and to avoid unnecessary re-vaccination. Development of migrant-friendly strategies to facilitate migrants' access to vaccination and collection of vaccination uptake data among migrants is needed to meet existing gaps."	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31296374	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296374	vaccine	8497861351486449784

Glucocorticoids (GCs) play an important role in the stress reaction and function in the development of multiple tissues in our body. When given chronically in supraphysiologic doses, GCs are associated with orthodontic tooth movement, with serious side effects and particularly adverse effects on bone metabolism. However, the effects of steroids on bone cell dynamics are incompletely understood. Therefore, in this present study we examined the participation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in osterix-DsRed/TRAP-EGFP double transgenic (Tg) medaka treated with synthetic GCs. Chronic continuous administration of prednisolone (PN) significantly reduced the fluorescence signals in the whole body of both osterix-DsRed and TRAP-EGFP medaka at 18 days, and those of the pharyngeal bone and tooth region at 32 days. To examine the capacity of the medaka for fracture healing during chronic administration of PN, we caused a fracture of a part of the bony fin ray at 18 days after the initiation of PN continuous administration. The bone fracture healing was significantly delayed by 32 days, accompanied by decreased signal area of both osterix-DsRed and TRAP-EGFP compared with that of the control. Next, to investigate the effect of acute administration of GC on the fracture healing, we started administration of dexamethasone (DX) immediately after the bone fracture, and this administration lasted during the 11 days of fracture healing. The results showed that the TRAP-EGFP-positive osteoclasts were reduced in area, but not the osterix-DsRed-positive osteoblasts.

This study was conducted to clarify the potential mechanisms of Troxerutin neuroprotection against Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation through targeting the SIRT1/SIRT3 signaling pathway. To establish a model, a single dose of LPS (500μg/kg body weight) was injected to male Wistar rats intraperitoneally. Troxerutin (100 mg/kg body weight) was injected intraperitoneally for 5 days after induction of the model. Cognitive and behavioral evaluations were performed using Y-maze, single-trial passive avoidance, and novel object recognition tests. The expression of inflammatory mediators, SIRT1/SIRT3, and P53 was measured using the ELISA assay. Likewise, the expression levels of SIRT1/SIRT3 and NF-κB were determined using Western blot assay. Brain acetyl-cholinesterase activity was determined by utilizing the method of Ellman. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected using Fluorescent probe 2, 7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). Furthermore, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined. A single intraperitoneal injection of LPS was led to ROS production, acute neuroinflammation, apoptotic cell death, and inactivation of the SIRT1/SIRT3 signaling pathway. Likewise, ELISA assay demonstrated that post-treatment with Troxerutin considerably suppressed LPS-induced acute neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis and subsequently memory impairments by targeting SIRT1/SIRT3 signaling pathway. Western blot assay confirmed ELISA results about SIRT1/SIRT3 and NF-κB proteins. These results suggest that Troxerutin can be a suitable candidate to treat neuroinflammation caused by neurodegenerative disorders.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313124	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313124	stress	1137471872769164371

604	604	512	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	Report on the AASLD/EASL Joint Workshop on Clinical Trial Endpoints in NAFLD.	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global public health concern. Its natural history, the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis, is highly variable, prone to endogenous (e.g., genetics, microbiota) and exogenous (e.g., nutrition, alcohol, physical activity) disease modifiers, and can fluctuate over time. The complexity of its pathophysiology is reflected by the multitude of pharmacological targets in development. NASH clinical trials have provided valuable insight that is applicable to future trial design. Endpoints for NASH have evolved over the past decade and will continue to be refined. Currently accepted endpoints for conditional approval include resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis and/or improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH by standardized evaluation of paired liver histology. In pediatric NASH, practical obstacles, pubertal hormonal changes, and stringent safety requirements mandate adaptations in trial design. In adult patients with NASH-related cirrhosis, clinical events (e.g. decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, transplantation, death) are more prevalent and thereby are viable primary endpoints. Consideration of the natural fluctuation of disease, the clinical implication of the chosen primary endpoint, and factors that may affect placebo response will facilitate an accurate determination of efficacy of emerging therapeutics for NASH. Conclusion: The June 2018 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and European Association for the Study of the Liver joint workshop on NAFLD endpoints summarized important findings from ongoing and completed trials, defined the scientific evidence supporting distinct endpoints, and provided guidance for future trial design.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31287572	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287572	Cirrhosis	1306706744219888810

610	610	119	MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report	Workplace Secondhand Tobacco Smoke Exposure Among U.S. Nonsmoking Workers, 2015.	Secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) exposure contributes to ill health and disease, including heart disease, lung cancer, and stroke (1). Although cigarette smoking has declined among U.S. workers, workplace exposure to SHS remains high, particularly among workers in certain industries, such as construction (2,3). Implementation of smoke-free laws has proven to be beneficial in reducing SHS exposure in general (1). CDC analyzed data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Occupational Health Supplement to assess the prevalence of self-reported workplace SHS exposure among nonsmoking workers by smoke-free policy status in the workers' states of residence and in detailed industry categories and subcategories. In 2015, 19.9% of nonsmoking workers reported any exposure to SHS at work during the 12 months preceding the interview, and 10.1% reported frequent exposure (twice a week or more). Nonsmoking workers who resided in states with comprehensive smoke-free laws in all three categories of venues (private worksites, bars, and restaurants) were least likely to report frequent exposure to workplace SHS. Nonsmoking workers employed in the commercial and industrial machinery and equipment repair and maintenance industry reported the highest prevalences of any workplace SHS exposure (65.1%), whereas the construction industry had the highest reported number of exposed workers (2.9 million); these industry categories/subcategories include outdoor workplaces and other settings that are unlikely to be protected by smoke-free laws. Identifying specific at-risk workplaces and implementing targeted intervention strategies could help reduce SHS exposure at work and protect workers' health.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31295233	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295233	heart+disease	408569329455206654

612	612	293	Veterinary parasitology	The Cryptosporidium parvum gp60 glycoprotein expressed in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila is immunoreactive with sera of calves infected with Cryptosporidium oocysts.	Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite of the phylum Apicomplexa responsible for cryptosporidiosis in calves, a disease that causes significant diarrhea and impairs gain of body weight, generating important production losses. As to now, no effective drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment or prevention of bovine cryptosporidiosis. Several reports suggest that development of a vaccine to prevent cryptosporidiosis is feasible, but relatively few vaccine candidates have been characterized and tested. The most prominent C. parvum antigen is gp60, an O-glycosylated mucin-like protein tethered to the parasite membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Gp60 has been shown to be involved in essential mechanisms for the survival of C. parvum, such as recognition, adhesion to, and invasion of host cells. This work was aimed at expressing gp60 in Tetrahymena thermophila, a ciliated protozoon with numerous advantages for the heterologous expression of eukaryotic proteins, as a first approach for the development of a recombinant vaccine for bovine cryptosporidiosis. T. thermophila-expressed gp60 localized to the protozoon cell surface and oral apparatus, and partitioned into the Triton X-114 detergent phase. This indicates that the protein entered the reticuloendothelial system of the ciliate, and suggests it contains a GPI-anchor. Homogenates of gp60-expressing T. thermophila cells were recognized by sera from calves naturally infected with C. parvum demonstrating their immunoreactivity. In summary, the heterologous expression of gp60, a C. parvum-encoded GPI-anchored protein, has been successfully demonstrated in the ciliate T. thermophila.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31303202	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303202	vaccine	-1852324383183073754

Exposure to organic dusts is an independent causative factor of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Unhealthy dietary patterns have been associated with poor lung function in smokers. This study investigated whether dietary patterns were associated with post-bronchodilator airway obstruction, a hallmark of COPD, in dairy farmers exposed to organic dusts. All subjects were identified by screening programs and patients with airflow obstruction were matched with subjects with normal spirometry. Six groups were compared, defined by their exposures (non-smoking dairy farmers, smokers ≥ 10 pack-years with no occupational exposure, and smoking dairy farmers) and the presence or absence of post-bronchodilator airflow obstruction, resulting in 321 study subjects. The Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) score was calculated based on an adapted food frequency questionnaire. Mean total AHEI scores were similar in all groups. Comparison between smokers with post-bronchodilator airway obstruction and subjects with post-bronchodilator airway obstruction related to occupational exposure found minimal differences in dietary patterns: dairy farmers had lower scores for the ratio of white to red meat and higher scores for cereal fiber consumption. As in previous studies, smokers with post-bronchodilator airway obstruction exhibited higher lipid intakes and lower carbohydrate intakes than their counterparts with normal spirometry. No evidence of any meaningful difference in dietary patterns was found between subjects with post-bronchodilator airway obstruction detected by screening and healthy controls, either in dairy farmers or in smokers with no occupational exposure.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31298600	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298600	smoking	2990005046938769485

Severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children is most frequently caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV infects the smallest airways, making breathing difficult and in some infants requiring medical support. Severity is affected by viral dose, infant age, virus genotype, and effectiveness of the innate/adaptive immune responses. Severe disease correlates with later wheezing and asthma in some children. The adaptive immune response is protective but wanes after each infection, likely due to the ability of the RSV NS1/NS2 proteins to inhibit the innate immune response. Several vaccine approaches and candidates are currently in clinical trials.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31284923	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284923	asthma	-1622037268576555626
622	622	589	Journal of clinical monitoring and computing	Feasibility evaluation of non-invasive cardiac function technology during echocardiography-based cardiac stress testing.	Evaluation of cardiac function during periods of stress is of key importance for the perioperative setting. Non-invasive hemodynamic monitors provide markers of cardiac function. This pilot study sought to evaluate the ability of a non-invasive hemodynamic monitor to detect cardiac stress during formal stress echocardiography testing. The primary goal was to compare the change in hemodynamic values during the pre/during/post phases of stress echocardiography testing in patients who had results negative versus positive for myocardial ischemia. Adult patients scheduled for outpatient cardiac stress testing were screened. Only patients scheduled for stress-echocardiography testing were consented. Patients with history of arrhythmias were excluded. During the testing, patients wore a cuff-based hemodynamic sensor (Nexfin system, Edwards Lifesciences). Data from the hemodynamic sensor were compared to the findings of the stress study. A total of 37 patients were enrolled, with 31 patients included for analysis. Five patients had stress studies positive for coronary ischemia. Comparison of the hemodynamic variables between patients who had a positive stress study versus negative showed a significant reduction in the percentage change in dP/dt and stroke volume from baseline (p < 0.05). This pilot study indicates that patients who have abnormal stress echocardiograms also have significantly reduced values from a noninvasive hemodynamic monitor. Further evaluation of the clinical utility of this technology, to assist in the care of patients at risk for cardiac ischemia, should be carried out.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31302789	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302789	stroke	-1444481301861872291

Interestingly, geographic region appears to wield a strong influence; in the correlation between number of tests and number of respirologists, physicians from Western provinces (i.e., Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia) administered fewer tests than their Eastern colleagues. Given the association between inadequate application of BCT and misdiagnosis of asthma, physicians should pay special attention to the Canadian guidelines when considering an asthma diagnosis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Canada	31297005	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297005	asthma	4918358495761748770
624	624	16	Human pathology	Immune checkpoint blocker-related sarcoid-like granulomatous inflammation: a rare adverse event detected in lymph node aspiration cytology of patients treated for advanced malignant melanoma.	Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a major breakthrough in the field of oncology. Targets for approved immune checkpoint inhibitors are cytotoxic T-lymphocytes-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death receptor 1/ programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1). Methods and Materials Five patients (four males and one female) were treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors for advanced melanoma (stage III). None of them had prior history of autoimmune disorders, AIDS, or sarcoidosis. The PET/CT imaging studies showed new onset lymphadenopathy suspicious for malignancy. Four patients had cutaneous melanoma and one had vaginal melanoma. Three patients were treated with single agent (two Nivolumab, one Ipilimumab) and two with double agents (Ipilimumab and Pembrolizumab, or Ipilimumab and Nivolumab). PET/CT showed mediastinal multistational lymphadenopathy in four cases and peri-portal lymphadenopathy in one patient. Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy showed numerous sarcoid-like granulomatous inflammation, while the fungal and mycobacterial infections were excluded. Cytomorphologically, the granulomas were numerous, mostly large, cellular and non-necrotizing. Multi-nucleated giant were rare or not seen at all. Cell blocks did not show any fibrosis. Other adverse effects included mouth sores, flu-like symptoms, arthritis, muscle aches, skin rashes, mild and severe colitis. The treatment was stopped and patients received prednisone. One patient developed severe adrenal insufficiency, which prolonged prednisone tapering. Their condition improved and lymphadenopathy was resolved in follow-up imaging. Sarcoid-like granulomatous inflammation is an adverse event in patients treated with immune checkpoint therapy such as Ipilimumab and Nivolumab. It can present as enlarged lymph nodes in PET/CT imaging suspicious for malignancy. FNA can serve as a minimally invasive tool to investigate the underlying cause of lymphadenopathy in this subset of patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31279873	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31279873	flu	6015995473246774717

Patients, who were eculizumab naïve at baseline and had ≥ 1% PNH clone size, were eligible for this analysis. Totally, 1793 patients were enrolled and divided into two cohorts, Asian (N = 246) and non-Asian (N = 1547). The Asian cohort was further divided into Asians in Asia cohort (N = 202) and Asians in non-Asia cohort (N = 44), based on geographical region. The Asian cohort had significantly higher PNH clone size in granulocytes, higher lactate dehydrogenase levels, and lower hemoglobin levels. However, the frequencies of symptoms including abdominal pain, backache, easy bleeding, fatigue and headache at baseline were significantly lower in the Asian cohort. The proportion of patients with a history of thromboembolism (TE) was significantly lower in the Asian than in the non-Asian cohort (3.6% vs. 8.9%, P < 0.01); however, there was no difference between Asians in Asia and Asians in non-Asia (3.3% vs. 4.9%, P = 0.61). These findings suggested that genetic factors may play a stronger role in developing TE than lifestyle factors in PNH patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Japan	31278635	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31278635	headache	5514214996211995551
634	634	225	Glia	Persistent increase in ventral hippocampal long-term potentiation by juvenile stress: A role for astrocytic glutamine synthetase.	A traumatic childhood is among the most important risk factors for developing stress-related psychopathologies such as posttraumatic stress disorder or depression later in life. However, despite the proven role of astrocytes in regulating transmitter release and synaptic plasticity, the contribution of astrocytic transmitter metabolism to such stress-induced psychopathologies is currently not understood. In rodents, childhood adversity can be modeled by juvenile stress exposure, resulting in increased anxiety, and impaired coping with stress in adulthood. We describe that such juvenile stress in rats, regardless of additional stress in adulthood, leads to reduced synaptic efficacy in the ventral CA1 (vCA1) Schaffer collaterals, but increased long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission after high-frequency stimulation. We tested whether the glutamate-glutamine-cycle guides the lasting changes on plasticity observed after juvenile stress by blocking the astrocytic glutamate-degrading enzyme, glutamine synthetase (GS). Indeed, the pharmacological inhibition of GS by methionine sulfoximine in slices from naïve rats mimics the effect of juvenile stress on vCA1-LTP, while supplying glutamine is sufficient to normalize the LTP. Assessing steady-state mRNA levels in the vCA1 stratum radiatum reveals distinct shifts in the expression of GS, astrocytic glutamate, and glutamine transporters after stress in juvenility, adulthood, or combined juvenile/adult stress. While GS mRNA expression levels are lastingly reduced after juvenile stress, GS protein levels are maintained stable. Together our results suggest a critical role for astrocytes and the glutamate-glutamine cycle in mediating long-term effects of juvenile stress on plasticity in the vCA1, a region associated with anxiety and emotional memory processing.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313857	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313857	depression	-5411404485622449820

Symptoms of babesiosis can range from a mild flu-like illness to acute, severe, and fatal disease. Severe disease is common in older populations and immunocompromised patients. The laboratory abnormalities associated with babesiosis, such as low hematocrit, low hemoglobin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, low haptoglobin, reticulocytosis, the presence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear and thrombocytopenia, can mimic other severe systemic disorders like thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).

An effect size for higher mortality among HIV+ patients compared with HIV- patients was noted but was not significant. Tuberculosis infection was prevalent compared with previous studies.This study reinforces the need for enhanced screening and early treatment of ear disease to minimize associated mortality and morbidity, particularly in immunocompromised patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31295202	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295202	tuberculosis	-4761420664091904483

Diet can influence different stages of inflammation and can have an important impact on several inflammatory diseases. Increasing scientific evidence has shown that polyphenolic compounds, such as flavonoids, which are found in fruits, vegetables, legumes, or cocoa, can have anti-inflammatory properties. Recent studies have demonstrated that flavonoids can inhibit regulatory enzymes or transcription factors important for controlling mediators involved in inflammation. Flavonoids are also known as potent antioxidants with the potential to attenuate tissue damage or fibrosis. Consequently, numerous studies in vitro and in animal models have found that flavonoids have the potential to inhibit the onset and development of inflammatory diseases. In the present review, we focused in flavonoids, the most abundant polyphenols in the diet, to give an overview of the most recent scientific knowledge about their impact on different inflammatory diseases.	2019	eng	Review	England	31288163	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288163	asthma	-6467708104873171151

Interarm blood pressure difference (IAD) is a risk factor for peripheral artery disease and cardio-cerebral vascular disease (CCVD). The current study examines the association of IAD with stroke and coronary heart disease in a Chinese community. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Pudong New Area in Shanghai, China. A total of 10 657 residents aged 15 years and older were randomly selected through three-stage sampling. Volunteers had systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) measured in both arms at recruitment, and IAD was defined in both arms as the absolute difference in BP. Medical records of study participants were reviewed by investigators to confirm measurements. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between systolic interarm blood pressure difference (sIAD) and diastolic interarm blood pressure difference (dIAD) with stroke and coronary heart disease. Compared with dIAD <5 mm Hg, the multivariate adjusted odds ratio (OR) of stroke prevalence was 1.357 (95% CI 0.725-2.542, P = 0.034) for dIAD ≥20 mm Hg and 1.702 (95% CI1.025-2.828, P = 0.040) for dIAD between 15 and 19 mm Hg, and the multivariate adjusted OR of coronary heart disease prevalence was 1.726 (95% CI 1.093-2.726, P = 0.019) for dIAD ≥20 mm Hg and 1.498 (95% CI 0.993-2.261, P = 0.044) for dIAD between 15 and 19 mm Hg. The relationship between cardio-cerebral vascular disease and dIAD was significant in a Chinese community population. Further cohort studies are needed to investigate the association of different levels of IAD with the incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and subsequent mortality.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31304684	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304684	stroke	2817960273225808857

Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental chemical that has adverse effects on health, probably causing childhood obesity. However, this association remains controversial, and it is difficult to find evidence for direct causality between environmental exposure and disease using epidemiological studies. In this study, we sought to elucidate the possible causality between BPA exposure and childhood obesity by conducting two meta-analyses showing bidirectional associations, including exposure effect by obesity and obesity risk by exposure. Articles published up to September 2017 were searched in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. We evaluated observational studies that included measurements of urinary BPA concentration and BMI or body weight. Of 436 articles, a total of 13 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Two meta-analyses were performed to investigate the association between BPA exposure and childhood obesity. The results showed that the relatively high-exposed group had a significantly higher risk of childhood obesity than the relatively low-exposed group (odds ratio = 1.566, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.097 to 2.234, 	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31311074	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311074	obesity	1286723199785027310

Aging processes have become an attractive field for researchers and annual fish have been used as biological models. However, the study on the changes in age-associated markers during the normal aging in wild populations of annual fish remains open. Austrolebias is a genus of Neotropical annual killifishes, distributed mainly in ephemeral pools across grassland floodplains of temperate South America and represent an emerging biological model for aging research, but studies investigating rapid aging and senescence in this genus of annual fish are almost non-existent. This study was undertaken to examine the changes in age-associated liver markers at the different developmental stages in wild populations of Austrolebias minuano. We demonstrate that A. minuano has a number of liver alterations of different severities throughout the life cycle, suggesting that these changes tend to increase with age. Our results revealed that > 70% of the analyzed livers presented alterations. Thus, our study should instigate new approaches on aging using Neotropical annual fish, and could be useful to improve the knowledge already provided by consecrated biological aging models as e.g. Nothobranchius killifishes.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31302822	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302822	aging	2280365999288629014

651	651	10	 	Transplant Preparation	HSCT is a complex procedure, which involves a long and complicated pathway for the patient and the intervention of many health professionals. Within this multidisciplinary team, the transplant coordinator, usually a nurse, is the ‘essential marrow’, the heart and the vital backbone of this procedure; they are an essential transplant ingredient facilitating a fluidity of the pathway and a good transmission of information. Written information about the procedure is beneficial for patients either prior to clinic visit or during clinic to allow the patients and relatives to reflect on conversations. Transplantation carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality, and these should be considered regarding the ‘need’ to transplant, based upon risk of disease, versus risk of the transplant. Pre-transplant assessments must also be undertaken, and the results of these along with suitable donor medical clearance and cell availability are essential to ascertain that transplant is a valid option and can proceed safely. Dealing with fertility preservation upon diagnosis of cancer is often challenging; this issue is even more complex for paediatric patients. PDWP recommends that counselling about fertility preservation opportunities should be offered to each patient receiving HSCT. This chapter will also focus on vascular access for optimal treatment of haematology patients because stem cell treatment cannot be performed without it. Constant advances in haematology have raised challenging ethical dilemmas concerning end of life, palliative care, patient information, donor concerns and impartiality and issues related to the risk we run to our patients. Nurses provide a key role in patient education, providing pre- and post-transplant advocacy and counselling, plan hospitalisations and consultations. They also act as educators and role models to nursing students and share knowledge in accordance with local policies and JACIE guidelines.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314318	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314318	cancer	2793899372921426050

653	653	664	 	Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: The Overlooked Complication of Type 2 Diabetes	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common complication of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Most times it is an unrecognized comorbidity to the primary care provider and endocrinologist. Today it is the most common chronic liver disease in developed countries. It is characterized by insulin resistance and hepatic triglyceride accumulation in the absence of co-existing etiologies, such as excessive alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis, medications or other etiologies for hepatic steatosis. Its more severe form of the disease with steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with hepatocyte injury (necrosis and inflammation) and frequently with fibrosis. Although it appears to be an indolent condition, with few symptoms and often normal plasma aminotransferases, NASH is a leading cause of end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and significantly increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and T2DM. The pathogenesis of NASH remains poorly understood, and likely to be multifactorial, but insulin-resistant adipose tissue plays an important role. The natural history of NAFLD is incompletely understood, but risk factors for disease progression include weight gain, obesity and T2DM, as well as the severity of fibrosis stage at diagnosis. Diagnostic algorithms are evolving but we offer an approach that integrates for the non-hepatologist plasma biomarkers, imaging, and the role of liver biopsy for the management of these complex patients. At the present time, early screening -with biomarker panels or a liver ultrasound, ideally with transient elastography- is reserved for high-risk patients (i.e., obese patients with T2DM or elevated plasma AST/ALT levels or evidence of steatosis at a random liver exam) until more accurate non-invasive methods are available. A liver biopsy should be considered on a case-by-case basis, to identify those at risk of NASH-cirrhosis, working in close collaboration with a hepatologist. Treatment should include a comprehensive approach with lifestyle modification and therapeutic agents tested in RCTs, such as vitamin E (in patients without diabetes) or pioglitazone for patients with or without diabetes. Pioglitazone, given its low-cost as a generic medication, long-standing track record of efficacy in NASH, and cardiometabolic benefits, is likely to be for NASH what metformin has become for the management of T2DM. However, proper patient selection and close monitoring is needed. In addition, a number of new pharmacological agents are being studied in phase II/III trials and future management will involve the use of combination therapy, as for other chronic metabolic conditions. In summary, endocrinologists need to be aware of the severe metabolic and liver-specific complications of NASH and establish early-on a long-term management plan. Screening will likely take place in the same way as for diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy. A better understanding of its natural history and pathogenesis of NASH, combined with improved diagnostic and treatment options, will likely place endocrinologists at the forefront of the management efforts to prevent end-stage liver disease in patients with NASH.

"Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) describes a rare heterogenous neurodegenerative syndrome with early visuospatial and visuoperceptual deficits due to atrophy of parieto-occipital brain regions. Here, we describe the case of a 62-year-old woman showing severe cognitive impairments as well as hemianopsia and all core symptoms of Bálint's syndrome. Years ago, the patient had complained about a ""tunnel view"" and concentration problems. The diagnostic results point to a case of PCA with underlying Alzheimer pathology. The disease course until diagnosis lasted for 7 years, reflecting the diagnostic difficulties with this still largely unknown syndrome. The unfamiliar symptom presentation including fluctuations in cognitive performance, affective symptoms, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, which were at first inconspicuous, and a former suspected diagnosis of dissociative pseudodementia, altogether brought considerable uncertainty to the involved health-care professionals. We conclude that cases of ""atypical dementia"" presenting with visual symptoms, even if appearing unspecific at first, are suspect of PCA. This case report provides an ostensive overview of PCA, including imaging data, CSF-findings, original drawings and handwriting samples from the patient."	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31203704	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31203704	Alzheimer	-3820497466351868775

BACKGROUND The relationships between culprit coronary plaque characteristics and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) are not fully understood in young patients. In this study we investigated the relationship between culprit atherosclerotic plaque phenotype assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) in young patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS We investigated the OCT imaging and HHcy of 123 lesions in 123 young patients (≤45 years of age). According to OCT images, culprit lesions were classified as thin-cap fiber atheroma (TCFA), thrombus, and other. The 123 patients were grouped as: HHcy group (53 cases, HHcy ≥15.5 µmol/l) and control group (70 cases, HHcy <15.5 µmol/l). RESULTS Compared with the control group, the HHcy group had a higher proportion of OCT-TCFA (p=0.03), OCT-vasa vasorum (p=0.013), and OCT-thrombus (p=0.012), and a larger lipid arc (p=0.002). HHcy (P=0.037) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) (P=0.016) remained independent predictors of TCFAs. HHcy (P=0.026) and smoking (P=0.005) remained independent determinants of thrombus. CONCLUSIONS HHcy and MetS are associated with TCFAs, and HHcy and smoking are associated with thrombus in young patients with coronary artery disease.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313754	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313754	smoking	910894669274456978

The purpose of this cross-sectional survey study was to explore common barriers to adequate Pap smear utilization among homeless women, and the factors that may relate to cervical cancer testing in this population. Participants consisted of adult women recruited at a healthcare facility for the homeless. Data were collected through a self-completed questionnaire on knowledge, attitudes and intentions about Pap smears and cervical cancer. Analyses included descriptive and inferential statistics. Sixty participants who had experienced homelessness within the past year completed the study. The most frequently mentioned barrier to testing was not having enough time to obtain a Pap smear (n = 33; 55%). Linear regression found that there were no significant relationships between knowledge and attitudes about cervical cancer and intention to get a Pap smear. However, the study did find that women with a positive previous Pap smear experience had more positive attitudes about the process and outcomes of Pap smears (p = 0.011, p = 0.00, respectively). Participants with more knowledge about cervical cancer were less negative about Pap smear outcomes (p = 0.05), and that women with negative attitudes about Pap smear outcomes were less likely to have obtained a Pap smear in the past (p = 0.033). Interventions that promote positive attitudes about testing and outcomes, minimizing stress and inconvenience during the test, as well as increasing the ease of scheduling an appointment may help break down barriers to cervical cancer screening among homeless women.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31313028	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313028	stress	-5756697018315640725

Cell senescence is one of the hallmarks of aging known to negatively influence a healthy lifespan. Drugs able to kill senescent cells specifically in cell culture, termed senolytics, can reduce the senescent cell burden in vivo and extend healthspan. Multiple classes of senolytics have been identified to date including HSP90 inhibitors, Bcl-2 family inhibitors, piperlongumine, a FOXO4 inhibitory peptide and the combination of Dasatinib/Quercetin. Detection of SA-β-Gal at an increased lysosomal pH is one of the best characterized markers for the detection of senescent cells. Live cell measurements of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity using the fluorescent substrate C12FDG in combination with the determination of the total cell number using a DNA intercalating Hoechst dye opens the possibility to screen for senotherapeutic drugs that either reduce overall SA-β-Gal activity by killing of senescent cells (senolytics) or by suppressing SA-β-Gal and other phenotypes of senescent cells (senomorphics). Use of a high content fluorescent image acquisition and analysis platform allows for the rapid, high throughput screening of drug libraries for effects on SA-β-Gal, cell morphology and cell number.	2019	eng	Video-Audio Media	United States	31305507	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305507	aging	5965544132537436406

The Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) axis has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a variety of mood and cognitive disorders. Neuroendocrine studies have demonstrated HPA axis overactivity in major depression, a relationship of HPA axis activity to cognitive performance, and a potential role of HPA axis genetic variation in cognition. In schizophrenia differential HPA activity has been found, including higher rates of non-suppression to dexamethasone challenge and higher salivary cortisol levels, which have been a premonitory risk factor for conversion to psychosis in adolescents at risk for developing schizophrenia. The present study investigated the simultaneous roles HPA axis activity and clinical symptomatology play in poor cognitive performance. Patients with major depression with psychosis (PMD) or schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SCZ) and healthy controls (HC) were studied. All participants underwent a diagnostic interview and psychiatric ratings, a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, and overnight hourly blood sampling for cortisol. Cognitive performance did not differ between the clinical groups, though they both performed more poorly than the HC's across a variety of cognitive domains. Across all subjects, cognitive performance was negatively correlated with higher cortisol, and PMD patients had higher evening cortisol levels than did SCZ and HCs. Cortisol and clinical symptoms, as well as age, sex, and antipsychotic use predicted cognitive performance. Diathesis stress models and their links to symptomatology, cognition, and HPA function are discussed.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31307859	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307859	depression	-4295420427690447901

We prospectively enrolled 103 participants who underwent CSF studies for meningitis. Using a standardized protocol, CSF opening pressure (OP) and closing pressure (CP) were measured, and cerebrospinal elastance (ECS) and pressure-volume index (PVI) were investigated. Within 14 days after dural puncture, we confirmed PDPH. According to PDPH development, the CSF pressure factors and clinical variables were compared between PDPH and non-PDPH group. Of the 103 participants, 100 (97.0%) had decreased CP, 16 (15.5%) had values below 6 cmH	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31312175	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312175	headache	-9002191823887486987

Non-vitamin K antagonists oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have recently challenged vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs) for stroke and systemic embolism prophylaxis in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Nevertheless, little information is available in routine clinical practice for France. The aim of this study is to describe the effectiveness and safety of apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran or VKAs in routine clinical practice in adult NVAF patients for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in France. The NAXOS study is a nationwide observational retrospective cohort generated from the French national healthcare insurance database (SNIIRAM-a comprehensive in- and outpatient healthcare consumption database), consisting of eight distinct sub-cohorts of anticoagulant-naive or anticoagulant-experienced patients diagnosed with NVAF, newly initiated with either NOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban) or VKAs. Patients will be included if initiating a new anticoagulant treatment for AF during the study period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016. Primary effectiveness outcome will be the incidence of stroke or systemic thromboembolic events; primary safety outcome will be the incidence of major bleeding during the exposure period. The NAXOS study will provide routine clinical practice data on the effectiveness and safety profiles of apixaban vs other NOACs and VKAs in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF in clinical practice conditions in France.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313832	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313832	stroke	4089568303716665454

Mast cell lipid bodies are key to initiation, maintenance and resolution of inflammatory responses in tissue. Mast cell lines, primary bone marrow-derived mast cells and peripheral blood basophils present a 'steatotic' phenotype in response to chronic insulin exposure, where cells become loaded with lipid bodies. Here we show this state is associated with reduced histamine release, but increased capacity to release bioactive lipids. We describe the overall lipid phenotype of mast cells in this insulin-induced steatotic state and the consequences for critical cellular lipid classes involved in stages of inflammation. We show significant insulin-induced shifts in specific lipid classes, especially arachidonic acid derivatives, MUFA and PUFA, the EPA/DHA ratio, and in cardiolipins, especially those conjugated to certain DHA and EPAs. Functionally, insulin exposure markedly alters the FcεRI-induced release of Series 4 leukotriene LTC4, Series 2 prostaglandin PGD2, Resolvin-D1, Resolvin-D2 and Resolvin-1, reflecting the expanded precursor pools and impact on both the pro-inflammation and pro-resolution bioactive lipids that are released during mast cell activation. Chronic hyperinsulinemia is a feature of obesity and progression to Type 2 Diabetes, these data suggest that mast cell release of key lipid mediators is altered in patients with metabolic syndrome.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31311389	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311389	diabetes	7273139206342584600

ALDH2 deficiency is associated with an increased risk of alcohol related-HCC development from fibrosis in patients and in mice. Mechanistic studies reveal a novel mechanism that Aldh2-deficient hepatocytes promote alcohol-associated HCC by transferring harmful oxidized mtDNA-enriched EVs into HCC and subsequently activating multiple oncogenic pathways in HCC. Lay Summary Alcoholics with ALDH2 polymorphism have an increased risk of digestive track cancer development, however, the link between ALDH2 deficiency and HCC development has not been well established. In this study, we show that ALDH2 deficiency exacerbates alcohol-associated HCC development both in patients and mouse models. Mechanistic studies revealed that after chronic alcohol exposure, Aldh2-deficient hepatocytes produce a large amount of harmful oxidized mitochondrial DNA via extracellular vesicles, which can be delivered into neighboring HCC cells and subsequently activate multiple oncogenic pathways, thereby promoting HCC.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31279903	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31279903	Cirrhosis	2670715450352290324

The ductus venosus (DV) is a shunt that allows the direct flow of well-oxygenated blood from the umbilical vein (UV) to the coronary and cerebral circulation through the foramen ovale. Its agenesis has been associated with chromosomal abnormalities and rare genetic syndromes, structural defects, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and even antepartum fetal demise. Pallister-Killian Syndrome (PKS) is a rare sporadic disorder with specific tissue mosaic distribution of an extra 12p isochromosome (i(12p)). Its main clinical features are moderate to severe intellectual disability/neuromotor delay, skin pigmentation abnormalities, typical facial appearance, variable association with multiple congenital malformations and epilepsy. Though prenatal findings (including congenital diaphragmatic hernia, ventriculomegaly, congenital heart disease, polyhydramnios, and rhizomelic shortening) have been described in literature, prenatal diagnosis is difficult as there are no associated identification signs no distinctive or pathognomonic signs, and some of these malformations are hard to identify prenatally. The tissue mosaicism linked to this syndrome and the decrease of the abnormal clone carrier of the i(p12) after successive trypsinizations of cultured cells makes the diagnosis even more challenging. We present the case of a 27.5 weeks pregnant woman with a fetal ductus venosus agenesis (DVA) as the main guide marker. To our knowledge this is the first case published in literature reporting a DVA as a guide sign to diagnose a complex condition as Pallister-Killian syndrome. We also underscore the key role of new genetic techniques as microarrays to avoid misdiagnosis when only a subtle sonographic sign is present in complex conditions like this.	2019	eng	Case Reports	Switzerland	31311125	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311125	heart+disease	-4524355549457527387

Goatpox (GTP), sheeppox (SPP) and lumpy skin disease (LSD) are three severe diseases of goat, sheep and cattle. Their typical clinical symptoms are characterized by vesicles, papules, nodules, pustules and scabs on animal skins. The GTP, SPP and LSD are caused by goatpox virus (GTPV), sheeppox virus (SPPV) and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), respectively, all of which belong to the genus Capripoxvirus in the family Poxviridae. Several capripoxvirus (CaPV) isolates have been virulently attenuated through serial passaging in vitro for production of live vaccines. CaPV-based vector systems have been broadly used to construct recombinant vaccines for delivering foreign antigens, many of which have been demonstrated to induce effective immune protections. Homologous recombination is the most commonly used method for constructing recombinant CaPVs. Here, we described a methodology for generation of recombinant CaPVs by the homologous recombination, and further reviewed CaPV-vectored vaccines for delivering foreign antigens.	2019	eng	Review	England	31300111	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300111	vaccine	3168079495368669052

691	691	262	Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience	Combinations of non-invasive indicators to detect dairy cows submitted to high-starch-diet challenge.	High-starch diets (HSDs) fed to high-producing ruminants are often responsible for rumen dysfunction and could impair animal health and production. Feeding HSDs are often characterized by transient rumen pH depression, accurate monitoring of which requires costly or invasive methods. Numerous clinical signs can be followed to monitor such diet changes but no specific indicator is able to make a statement at animal level on-farm. The aim of this pilot study was to assess a combination of non-invasive indicators in dairy cows able to monitor a HSD in experimental conditions. A longitudinal study was conducted in 11 primiparous dairy cows fed with two different diets during three successive periods: a 4-week control period (P1) with a low-starch diet (LSD; 13% starch), a 4-week period with an HSD (P2, 35% starch) and a 3-week recovery period (P3) again with the LSD. Animal behaviour was monitored throughout the experiment, and faeces, urine, saliva, milk and blood were sampled simultaneously in each animal at least once a week for analysis. A total of 136 variables were screened by successive statistical approaches including: partial least squares-discriminant analysis, multivariate analysis and mixed-effect models. Finally, 16 indicators were selected as the most representative of a HSD challenge. A generalized linear mixed model analysis was applied to highlight parsimonious combinations of indicators able to identify animals under our experimental conditions. Eighteen models were established and the combination of milk urea nitrogen, blood bicarbonate and feed intake was the best to detect the different periods of the challenge with both 100% of specificity and sensitivity. Other indicators such as the number of drinking acts, fat:protein ratio in milk, urine, and faecal pH, were the most frequently used in the proposed models. Finally, the established models highlight the necessity for animals to have more than 1 week of recovery diet to return to their initial control state after a HSD challenge. This pilot study demonstrates the interest of using combinations of non-invasive indicators to monitor feed changes from a LSD to a HSD to dairy cows in order to improve prevention of rumen dysfunction on-farm. However, the adjustment and robustness of the proposed combinations of indicators need to be challenged using a greater number of animals as well as different acidogenic conditions before being applied on-farm.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31311612	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311612	depression	7763750328910542816

Synovial sarcoma (SS) is a rare malignancy that most commonly involves the extremities and large joints. We describe a 67-year-old woman who presented with shortness of breath and flu-like symptoms, and a chest wall mass. On resection of the mass biphasic morphology of SS was noted, as well as confirmatory immunostains including TLE1 and bcl2. An SS18/SSX2 fusion transcript was detected by reverse transcriptase-DNA amplification. A year later, following chemotherapy, the patient developed a right-sided pleural effusion. Cytological examination of the fluid showed an epithelial population forming clusters and groups. TLE1 was positive, as well as fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis for the SS18/SSX2 fusion transcript. SS can be a challenging diagnosis in fluid-filled cavities, when the epithelial component predominates and its original biphasic quality is not seen.

Early life stress such as physical abuse, trauma or neglect during a critical period of development can elicit negative long-lasting effects on health. Neonatal maternal deprivation (MD) is a stressful event capable of triggering structural and neurobiological changes in Central Nervous System (CNS) development during proliferative and migratory cell differentiation. In this study, we investigated the maternal behavior of lactating rats submitted to protocol of chronic neonatal maternal deprivation (MD) during postnatal day (PND) 1 to 10. We analyzed the effects of the MD in the olfactory memory and cellular proliferation and differentiation in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb in Wistar rat pups on 7, 11 and 21 days postpartum. Analysis in active neurons, cellular differentiation and proliferation, were marked and evaluated by flow cytometry in tissue samples of hippocampi and olfactory bulb. Our results demonstrated an increase in maternal behavior immediately after dam's return to the home-cage in MD group compared to the non-deprived group. In addition, MD pups spent more time (higher latency) to identify the nest odor in comparison to the non-deprived rat pups in the olfactory learning task and showed a significant delay in the neural differentiation and proliferation in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. These results reveal that disruptions in the mother-infant bonding by the MD induce changes in maternal behavior and interaction with the offspring that could be leading to delayed CNS development and significant impairment in offspring's olfactory learning.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31310813	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310813	stress	-2388274433047018803

Diabetes increases the risk of liver disease progression and cirrhosis development in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The association between diabetes and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in NASH cirrhosis patients is not well quantified. All patients with the diagnosis of NASH cirrhosis seen at Mayo Clinic Rochester between January 2006 and December 2015 were identified. All adult liver transplant registrants with NASH between 2004 and 2017 were identified using the UNOS/OPTN registry for external validation. Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to investigate the association between diabetes and HCC risk. Among 354 Mayo Clinic patients with NASH cirrhosis, 253 (71%) had diabetes and 145 (41%) were male. Mean age at cirrhosis evaluation was 62. During a median follow up of 47 months, 30 patients developed HCC. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of developing HCC in univariate (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.1-11.9, P=0.04) and multivariable analysis (HR = 4.2, 95% CI =1.2-14.2, P=0.02). In addition, age (per decade: HR = 1.8, 95% CI =1.2-2.6, P<0.01) and low serum albumin (HR = 2.1, 95% CI =1.5-2.9, P<0.01) were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing HCC in multivariable analysis. Other metabolic risk factors including BMI, hyperlipidemia and hypertension were not associated with HCC risk. Among UNOS NASH registrants (N=6,630), 58% had diabetes. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of developing HCC in univariate (HR = 1.4, 95% CI =1.1-1.8, P<0.01) and multivariable (HR = 1.3, 95% CI =1.0-1.7, P=0.03) analysis.

700	700	13	Herz	Pulmonary hypertension and valvular heart disease.	Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients with left-sided heart disease, including valvular heart disease. In this context, elevated left atrial pressure primarily leads to the development of post-capillary PH. Despite the fact that repair of left-sided valvular heart disease by surgical or interventional approaches will improve PH, recent studies have highlighted that PH (pre- or post-interventional) remains an important predictor of long-term outcome. Here, we review the current knowledge on PH in valvular heart disease taking into account new hemodynamic PH definitions, and the distinction between post- and pre-capillary components of PH. A specific focus is on the precise characterization of hemodynamics and cardiopulmonary interaction, and on potential strategies for the management of residual PH after mitral or aortic valve interventions. In addition, we highlight the clinical significance of tricuspid regurgitation, which may occur as a primary condition or as a consequence of PH and right heart dilatation (functional). In this context, proper patient selection for potential tricuspid valve interventions is crucial. Finally, the article highlights gaps in evidence, and points toward future perspectives.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31312873	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312873	heart+disease	6876740810766966100

The increased prevalence of obesity significantly affects human health worldwide. Improvement of glycometabolism by dietotherapy/herbal remedy is an effective approach to ameliorate obesity. In this study, high-fat-diet induced obese (DIO) mice were treated with mulberry leaves for 13 weeks. The results showed that mulberry leaves significantly alleviated adiposity of DIO mice including reducing body weight gain, fat accumulation and fasting blood glucose, and improving insulin sensitivity. In addition, mulberry leaves had protective effects on liver and kidneys. The abundant flavonoids, polyphenols and 1-deoxynojirimycin in mulberry leaves were likely responsible for their beneficial effects. Mechanistically, we found that mulberry leaves could alleviate obesity by enhancing brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity partly indicated by elevated thermogenesis and overexpression of uncoupling protein 1 in BAT. Moreover, mulberry leaves significantly increased the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio and Akkermansia level that were closely associated with obesity development and progression, and decreased the potential proinflammatory Proteobacteria in feces. These findings reveal that the mulberry leaf is an edible plant food with therapeutic potential for obesity and may provide dietotherapy/herbal remedy to the treatment of obesity and its complications.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31312821	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312821	obesity	-6878119266243511199

707	707	239	Environmental toxicology	Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) increase rage signaling to promote downstream cardiovascular remodeling.	Exposure to environmental contaminants and consumption of a high, saturated fatty diet has been demonstrated to promote precursors for metabolic syndrome (hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia). The purpose of this study was to determine if exposure to the most prevalent environmental persistent organic pollutants (POPs) would act as causative agents to promote metabolic syndrome independent of dietary intake. We hypothesized that POPs will activate the advanced glycated end-product (AGE)-and receptor for AGE (RAGE) signaling cascade to promote downstream signaling modulators of cardiovascular remodeling and oxidative stress in the heart. At 5-weeks of age nondiabetic (WT) and diabetic (ob/ob) mice were exposed POPs mixtures by oral gavage twice a week for 6-weeks. At the end of 6-weeks, animals were sacrificed and the hearts were taken for biochemical analysis. Increased activation of the AGE-RAGE signaling cascade via POPs exposure resulted in elevated levels of fibroblast differentiation (α-smooth muscle actin) and RAGE expression indicated maladaptive cardiac remodeling. Conversely, the observed decreased superoxide dismutase-1 and -2 (SOD-1 and SOD-2) expression may exacerbate the adverse changes occurring as a result of POPs treatment to reduce innate cardioprotective mechanisms. In comparison, ventricular collagen levels were decreased in mice exposed to POPs. In conclusion, exposure to organic environmental pollutants may intensify oxidative and inflammatory stressors to overwhelm protective mechanisms allowing for adverse cardiac remodeling.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313498	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313498	diabetes	-7814257818245609902
708	708	626	Birth defects research	Smoking and pregnancy: Epigenetics and developmental origins of the metabolic syndrome.	Maternal smoking causes lower birth weight, birth defects, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Epidemiological evidence over the past four decades has grown stronger and the adverse outcomes attributed to maternal smoking and secondhand smoke exposure have expanded. This review presents findings of latent and persistent metabolic effects in offspring of smoking mothers like those observed in studies of maternal undernutrition during pregnancy. The phenotype of offspring of smoking mothers is like that associated with maternal undernutrition. Born smaller than offspring of nonsmokers, these children have increased risk of being overweight or obese later. Plausible mechanisms include in utero hypoxia, nicotine-induced reductions in uteroplacental blood flow, placental toxicity, or toxic growth restriction from the many toxicants in tobacco smoke. Studies have reported increased risk of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and hypertension although the evidence here is weaker than for overweight/obesity. Altered DNA methylation has been consistently documented in smoking mothers' offspring, and these epigenetic alterations are extensive and postnatally durable. A causal link between altered DNA methylation and the phenotypic changes observed in offspring remains to be firmly established, yet the association is strong, and mediation analyses suggest a causal link. Studies examining expression patterns of affected genes during childhood development and associated health outcomes should be instructive in this regard. The adverse effects of exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy now clearly include permanent metabolic derangements in offspring that can adversely affect life-long health.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31313499	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313499	obesity	3456446200772320915

710	710	253	Hippocampus	Interactive effects of stress reactivity and rapid eye movement sleep theta activity on emotional memory formation.	Sleep and stress independently enhance emotional memory consolidation. In particular, theta oscillations (4-7 Hz) during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep increase coherence in an emotional memory network (i.e., hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex) and enhance emotional memory. However, little is known about how stress during learning might interact with subsequent REM theta activity to affect emotional memory. In the current study, we examined whether the relationship between REM theta activity and emotional memory differs as a function of pre-encoding stress exposure and reactivity. Participants underwent a psychosocial stressor (the Trier Social Stress Task; n = 32) or a comparable control task (n = 32) prior to encoding. Task-evoked cortisol reactivity was assessed by salivary cortisol rise from pre- to post-stressor, and participants in the stress condition were additionally categorized as high or low cortisol responders via a median split. During incidental encoding, participants studied 150 line drawings of negative, neutral, and positive images, followed by the complete color photo. All participants then slept overnight in the lab with polysomnographic recording. The next day, they were given a surprise recognition memory task. Results showed that memory was better for emotional relative to neutral information. Critically, these findings were observed only in the stress condition. No emotional memory benefit was observed in the control condition. In stressed participants, REM theta power significantly predicted memory for emotional information, specifically for positive items. This relationship was observed only in high cortisol responders. For low responders and controls, there was no relationship between REM theta and memory of any valence. These findings provide evidence that elevated stress at encoding, and accompanying changes in neuromodulators such as cortisol, may interact with theta activity during REM sleep to promote selective consolidation of emotional information.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313866	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313866	stress	6569723785655740276
711	711	254	Veterinary immunology and immunopathology	Effect of progesterone on the vaccination and immune response against Chlamydia abortus in sheep.	Chlamydia abortus produces ovine enzootic abortion (OEA). Symptoms are not observed until the organism colonises the placenta, eventually causing abortion. Infected animals become carriers and will shed the organism in the following oestruses. This process suggests that sex hormones might play an important role in the physiopathology of OEA, affecting the success of chlamydial clearance and also jeopardising the effectiveness of vaccination. However, the mechanisms through which sex hormones are involved in chlamydial pathogenicity remain unclear. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine the effect of progesterone on the immune response against C. abortus and on the protection conferred by an experimental inactivated vaccine in sheep. Eighteen sheep were ovariectomised and divided into four groups: vaccinated and progesterone-treated (V-PG), vaccinated and non-treated (V-NT), non-vaccinated and non-treated (NV-NT) and non-vaccinated and progesterone-treated sheep (NV-PG). Animals from both PG groups were treated with commercial medroxyprogesterone acetate impregnated intravaginal sponges before and during the vaccination (V-PG) or just before challenge (NV-PG). The animals from both V groups were subcutaneously immunised with an experimental inactivated vaccine, which was seen to confer high protection in previous studies. All sheep were challenged intratracheally with C. abortus strain AB7 and were sacrificed on day 8 post-infection. Morbidity was measured as the variation in rectal temperature and samples of sera were collected for antibody and cytokine (IFN-γ and IL-10) analysis by commercial ELISA. In addition, lung and lymph node samples were collected for chlamydial detection by qPCR and for histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses. Sheep from the V-PG group showed less severe or no lesions and lower morbidity than the other groups. They also had the highest abundance of regulatory T-cells. The sheep from V-NT also manifested high antibody levels against C. abortus and less severe lesions than those observed in non-vaccinated sheep, which showed high morbidity, low antibody levels and severe lesions, especially in NV-NT. These results confirm the effectiveness of the experimental vaccine employed and suggest that progesterone could enhance the effect.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31307668	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307668	vaccine	614512039577184122

Cervical cancer is the fourth most communal malignant disease amongst women worldwide. In maximum circumstances, cervical cancer indications are not perceptible at its initial stages. There are a proportion of features that intensify the threat of emerging cervical cancer like human papilloma virus, sexual transmitted diseases, and smoking. Ascertaining those features and constructing a classification model to categorize, if the cases are cervical cancer or not is an existing challenging research. This learning intentions at using cervical cancer risk features to build classification model using Random Forest (RF) classification technique with the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and two feature reduction techniques recursive feature elimination and principle component analysis (PCA). Utmost medical data sets are frequently imbalanced since the number of patients is considerably fewer than the number of non-patients. For the imbalance of the used data set, SMOTE is cast-off to solve this problem. The data set comprises of 32 risk factors and four objective variables: Hinselmann, Schiller, Cytology and Biopsy. Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, PPA and NPA of the four variables remains accurate after SMOTE when compared with values obtained before SMOTE. An RSOnto ontology has been created to visualize the progress in classification performance.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31312985	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312985	smoking	-504935756748713175

715	715	722	Histology and histopathology	Melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells in aging and disease.	Melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) constitute a system in the mammalian retina used for irradiance detection, regulating non-image forming functions, such as photoentrainment of circadian rhythms, control of the pupillary light reflex, masking response, light-regulated melatonin secretion, and modulation of the sleep/wake cycle. There are five subtypes of mRGCs differentiated by morphology and function. Recent years of research on mRGCs have identified a broad number of neurodegenerative diseases in the eye and the brain with altered physiologic light responses, leading to disturbances of non-image forming light response(s). In this review, we briefly summarise the melanopsin system in the normal retina and discuss its role in connection to human aging (sleep/wake problems) and retinal pathology in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, diabetic retinopathy, mitochondrial optic neuropathies, glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, and in photophobia during migraine and in seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Finally, we discuss the diagnostic tools that are being used to differentiate retinal diseases involving the melanopsin system in the rods and cones from the inner versus the outer retina.	2019	eng	Review	Spain	31219170	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31219170	Alzheimer	3687286164936910007

Acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) constitute a substantial disease burden in adults and elderly individuals. We aimed to identify all case-control studies investigating the potential role of respiratory viruses in the etiology of ARI in older adults aged ≥65 years. We conducted a systematic literature review (across 7 databases) of case-control studies published from 1996 to 2017 that investigated the viral profile of older adults with and those without ARI. We then computed a pooled odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval and virus-specific attributable fraction among the exposed (AFE) for 8 common viruses: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (Flu), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenovirus (AdV), rhinovirus (RV), bocavirus (BoV), and coronavirus (CoV). From the 16 studies included, there was strong evidence of possible causal attribution for RSV (OR, 8.5 [95% CI, 3.9-18.5]; AFE, 88%), Flu (OR, 8.3 [95% CI, 4.4-15.9]; AFE, 88%), PIV (OR, not available; AFE, approximately 100%), HMPV (OR, 9.8 [95% CI, 2.3-41.0]; AFE, 90%), AdV (OR, not available; AFE, approximately 100%), RV (OR, 7.1 [95% CI, 3.7-13.6]; AFE, 86%) and CoV (OR, 2.8 [95% CI, 2.0-4.1]; AFE, 65%) in older adults presenting with ARI, compared with those without respiratory symptoms (ie, asymptomatic individuals) or healthy older adults. However, there was no significant difference in the detection of BoV in cases and controls. This review supports RSV, Flu, PIV, HMPV, AdV, RV, and CoV as important causes of ARI in older adults and provides quantitative estimates of the absolute proportion of virus-associated ARI cases to which a viral cause can be attributed. Disease burden estimates should take into account the appropriate AFE estimates (for older adults) that we report.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	30849176	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30849176	flu	-6056382045660082261

A 24-year-old Hispanic woman presented to our facility with a two-week history of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, and scleral icterus. Initial laboratory workup revealed elevated transaminases, direct hyperbilirubinemia, and positive anti-smooth muscle antibody. Liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis and our patient was started on oral prednisone therapy. Her liver enzymes initially began to normalize but then spontaneously started up-trending. She was subsequently readmitted to the hospital for further management, at which time she also complained of palpitations, heat intolerance, and sweating. Laboratory workup revealed hyperthyroidism secondary to Grave's disease. Our patient was not a candidate for methimazole or propylthiouracil treatment due to her hepatic dysfunction, so she was started on hydrocortisone due to its secondary effect of decreased conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine. She achieved biochemical remission of her autoimmune hepatitis on this regimen and was transitioned back to oral prednisone therapy. Her liver enzymes normalized once she underwent radioactive iodine ablation of her thyroid. This clinical course suggests that autoimmune hepatitis with concurrent Grave's disease may be refractory to treatment until the underlying hyperthyroid state is corrected.	2019	eng	Case Reports	United States	31281763	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31281763	Diarrhea	-894273917655637623

Despite the development of effective anti-viral therapeutics HCC is continuing to rise, in part driven by the epidemic of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Many patients present with advanced disease out with the criteria for transplant, resection or even locoregional therapy. Currently available therapeutics for HCC are effective in a small minority of individuals. However, there has been a major global interest in immunotherapies for cancer and although HCC has lagged behind other cancers, great opportunities now exist for treating HCC with newer and more sophisticated agents. Whilst checkpoint inhibitors are at the forefront of this revolution, other therapeutics such as inhibitory cytokine blockade, oncolytic viruses, adoptive cellular therapies and vaccines are emerging. Broadly these may be categorized as either boosting existing immune response or stimulating de novo immune response. Although some of these agents have shown promising results as monotherapy in early phase trials it may well be that their future role will be as combination therapy, either in combination with one another or in combination with treatment modalities such as locoregional therapy. Together these agents are likely to generate new and exciting opportunities for treating HCC, which are summarized in this review.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31293335	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293335	vaccine	7078276984547732873

The immunomodulatory potential and low incidence of severe side effects of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment led to its successful application in a variety of dermatological autoimmune diseases over the last two decades. IVIg is usually administered at a dose of 2 g per kg body weight distributed over 2-5 days every 4 weeks. They are most commonly used as a second- or third-line treatment in dermatological autoimmune disease (pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus, bullous pemphigoid, mucous membrane pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, dermatomyositis, systemic vasculitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus). However, first-line treatment may be warranted in special circumstances like concomitant malignancy, a foudroyant clinical course, and contraindications against alternative treatments. Furthermore, IVIg can be considered first line in scleromyxedema. Production of IVIg for medical use is strictly regulated to ensure a low risk of pathogen transmission and comparable quality of individual batches. More common side effects include nausea, headache, fatigue, and febrile infusion reactions. Serious side effects are rare and include thrombosis and embolism, pulmonary edema, renal failure, aseptic meningitis, and severe anaphylactic reactions. Regarding the mechanism of action, one can discriminate between functions of the Fcγ region and the F(ab)2 region and their effects on a cellular level. These functions are not mutually exclusive, and more than one pathway may contribute to the beneficial effects. Here, we present a historical background, details on manufacturing, hypotheses on the mechanisms of action, information on the clinical application in the abovementioned conditions, and a brief outlook on future directions of IVIg treatment in dermatology.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31244821	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244821	headache	-7714713652743527644

The present study aimed to analyze age-related changes to motor coordination, balance, spinal cord oxidative biomarkers in 3-, 6-, 18-, 24-, and 30-month-old rats. The effects of low-intensity exercise on these parameters were also analyzed in 6-, 18-, and 24-month-old rats. Body weight, blood glucose, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were assessed for all rats. The soleus muscle weight/body weight ratio was used to estimate skeletal muscle mass loss. Body weight increased until 24 months; only 30-month-old rats exhibited decreased blood glucose and increased total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. The soleus muscle weight/body weight ratio increased until 18 months, followed by a small decrease in old rats. Exercise did not change any of these parameters. Stride length and step length increased from adult to middle age, but decreased at old age. Stride width increased while the sciatic functional index decreased in old rats. Performance in the balance beam test declined with age. While gait did not change, balance improved after exercise. Aging increased superoxide anion generation, hydrogen peroxide levels, total antioxidant capacity, and superoxide dismutase activity while total thiol decreased and lipid hydroperoxides did not change. Exercise did not significantly change this scenario. Thus, aging increased oxidative stress in the spinal cord, which may be associated with age-induced changes in gait and balance. Regular low-intensity exercise is a good alternative for improving age-induced changes in balance, while beneficial effects on gait and spinal cord oxidative biomarkers cannot be ruled out because of the small number of rats investigated (n=5 or 6/group).	2019	eng	Journal Article	Brazil	31314852	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314852	aging	-1706114177222872702

The original discouraging results of ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) application in acute respiratory failure caused the technique to be almost abandoned. Fortunately, ECMO survived thanks to the good results obtained in neonates. The interest on ECMO renewed after the publication of the CESAR trial in 2009. The ultimate rebirth of the technique, however, was due to its use as a rescue therapy in severely hypoxemic patients untreatable with conventional methods during H1N1 flu epidemics in Australia and New Zealand. In 2018 the group of investigators led by Alain Combes designed and implemented the EOLIA study to test the efficacy of veno-venous ECMO in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This article discusses the primary and secondary results of the trial and the considerations emerged in the medical community. We will also discuss how ECMO could evolve to maximize lung protection rather than just prevent hypoxic death.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Italy	31124619	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31124619	flu	3375733407275108717

Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a slowly progressing neurodegenerative disease characterized by eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions in the nervous system and multiple visceral organs. The clinical manifestation of NIID varies widely, and both familial and sporadic cases have been reported. Here we have performed genetic linkage analysis and mapped the disease locus to 1p13.3-q23.1; however, whole-exome sequencing revealed no potential disease-causing mutations. We then performed long-read genome sequencing and identified a large GGC repeat expansion within human-specific NOTCH2NLC. Expanded GGC repeats as the cause of NIID was further confirmed in an additional three NIID-affected families as well as five sporadic NIID-affected case subjects. Moreover, given the clinical heterogeneity of NIID, we examined the size of the GGC repeat among 456 families with a variety of neurological conditions with the known pathogenic genes excluded. Surprisingly, GGC repeat expansion was observed in two Alzheimer disease (AD)-affected families and three parkinsonism-affected families, implicating that the GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC could also contribute to the pathogenesis of both AD and PD. Therefore, we suggest defining a term NIID-related disorders (NIIDRD), which will include NIID and other related neurodegenerative diseases caused by the expanded GGC repeat within human-specific NOTCH2NLC.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31178126	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31178126	Alzheimer	372648779227126668

751	751	745	eLife	Impaired skeletal muscle mitochondrial pyruvate uptake rewires glucose metabolism to drive whole-body leanness.	Metabolic cycles are a fundamental element of cellular and organismal function. Among the most critical in higher organisms is the Cori Cycle, the systemic cycling between lactate and glucose. Here, skeletal muscle-specific Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier (MPC) deletion in mice diverted pyruvate into circulating lactate. This switch disinhibited muscle fatty acid oxidation and drove Cori Cycling that contributed to increased energy expenditure. Loss of muscle MPC activity led to strikingly decreased adiposity with complete muscle mass and strength retention. Notably, despite decreasing muscle glucose oxidation, muscle MPC disruption increased muscle glucose uptake and whole-body insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, chronic and acute muscle MPC deletion accelerated fat mass loss on a normal diet after high fat diet-induced obesity. Our results illuminate the role of the skeletal muscle MPC as a whole-body carbon flux control point. They highlight the potential utility of decreasing muscle pyruvate utilization to ameliorate obesity and type 2 diabetes.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31305240	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305240	obesity	6369367631770966886

Mast cells are pluripotent leukocytes that reside in the mucosa and connective tissue. Recent studies show an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among patients with mastocytosis, which is a hematological disease that is characterized by the accumulation of mast cells due to clonal proliferation. This association suggests an important role for mast cells in cardiovascular disease. Indeed, the evidence establishing the contribution of mast cells to the development and progression of atherosclerosis is continually increasing. Mast cells may contribute to plaque formation by stimulating the formation of foam cells and causing a pro-inflammatory micro-environment. In addition, these cells are able to promote plaque instability by neo-vessel formation and also by inducing intraplaque hemorrhage. Furthermore, mast cells appear to stimulate the formation of fibrosis after a cardiac infarction. In this review, the available data on the role of mast cells in cardiovascular disease are summarized, containing both in vitro research and animal studies, followed by a discussion of human data on the association between cardiovascular morbidity and diseases in which mast cells are important: Kounis syndrome, mastocytosis and allergy.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31295950	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295950	asthma	7255021292858609470

Our study evaluated 163 individuals, being 74 soybean farmers, occupationally exposed to pesticides, and 89 individuals from Goias municipalities, Central Brazil, with similar conditions to the exposed group, comprising the control group. Of the 74 soybean farmers, 43 exposed directly to pesticides and 31 exposed indirectly. The exposed group consisted of individuals aged 19 to 63 years, 21 women and 53 men, and the control group had ages ranging from 18 to 64 years, being 36 women and 53 men. 18.9% of the exposed group were poisoned by pesticides, and the most common symptoms were headache and gastrointestinal problems. The genotype frequencies of the rs2031920 (T>C) polymorphism in the CYP2E1 gene present significant differences between the exposed and control groups (p = 0.02), showing that 24.3% of the exposed group were heterozygotes against 6.7% in the control group. For the OGG1 gene, two SNPs, rs1052133 (G>C) and rs293795 (T>C), were evaluated and the genotype frequencies were not statistically different between the exposed and control groups. The DNA damage was distinct (p < 0.05) in the three analyzed comet parameters (tail length, Olive tail moment, %DNA) between groups. However, there was no influence of age and alcohol consumption between the groups associated with the polymorphisms in the CYP2E1 and OGG1 genes and DNA damage. We also did not find altered hematological and biochemical parameters in the exposed group. Thus, this pioneering study at Goias State carried out an overview of the health of soybean farmers. We evaluated classic laboratory exams, associated with exposure markers (comet assay) and susceptibility markers (genetic polymorphisms), emphasizing the need to expand the Brazilian health assessment protocol. We found, in soybean farmers, increased DNA damage and a higher number of heterozygotes in CYP2E1 gene, compared with the control group, despite the lack of association with age, educational level, smoking, drinking habits, and genetic polymorphisms.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31292876	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292876	headache	-5579492244806284582
762	762	609	Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology	Striatal volume and functional connectivity correlate with weight gain in early-phase psychosis.	Second-generation antipsychotic drugs (SGAs) are essential in the treatment of psychotic disorders, but are well-known for inducing substantial weight gain and obesity. Critically, weight gain may reduce life expectancy for up to 20-30 years in patients with psychotic disorders, and prognostic biomarkers are generally lacking. Even though other receptors are also implicated, the dorsal striatum, rich in dopamine D2 receptors, which are antagonized by antipsychotic medications, plays a key role in the human reward system and in appetite regulation, suggesting that altered dopamine activity in the striatal reward circuitry may be responsible for increased food craving and the resultant weight gain. Here, we measured striatal volume and striatal resting-state functional connectivity at baseline, and weight gain over the course of 12 weeks of antipsychotic treatment in 81 patients with early-phase psychosis. We also included a sample of 58 healthy controls. Weight measurements were completed at baseline, and then weekly for 4 weeks, and every 2 weeks until week 12. We used linear mixed models to compute individual weight gain trajectories. Striatal volume and whole-brain striatal connectivity were then calculated for each subject, and used to assess the relationship between striatal structure and function and individual weight gain in multiple regression models. Patients had similar baseline weights and body mass indices (BMI) compared with healthy controls. There was no evidence that prior drug exposure or duration of untreated psychosis correlated with baseline BMI. Higher left putamen volume and lower sensory motor connectivity correlated with the magnitude of weight gain in patients, and these effects multiplied when the structure-function interaction was considered in an additional exploratory analysis. In conclusion, these results provide evidence for a correlation of striatal structure and function with antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Lower striatal connectivity was associated with more weight gain, and this relationship was stronger for higher compared with lower left putamen volumes.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31315130	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315130	obesity	49177526672934036

Type I interferons are highly potent cytokines essential for self-protection against tumors and infections. Deregulations of type I interferon signaling are associated with multiple diseases that require novel therapeutic options. Here, we identified the small molecule, IT1t, a previously described CXCR4 ligand, as a highly potent inhibitor of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)-mediated inflammation. IT1t inhibits chemical (R848) and natural (HIV) TLR7-mediated inflammation in purified human plasmacytoid dendritic cells from blood and human tonsils. In a TLR7-dependent lupus-like model, in vivo treatment of mice with IT1t drives drastic reduction of both systemic inflammation and anti-double-stranded DNA autoantibodies and prevents glomerulonephritis. Furthermore, IT1t controls inflammation, including interferon α secretion, in resting and stimulated cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Our findings highlight a groundbreaking immunoregulatory property of CXCR4 signaling that opens new therapeutic perspectives in inflammatory settings and autoimmune diseases.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31309143	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309143	HIV	-6324550271415246022

Polymer-grafted chromatography media, especially ion exchangers, are high performance materials for protein purification. However, due to the pore size limitation, conventional chromatography beads are usually not considered for the downstream processing of large biomolecules such as virus-like particles (VLPs).

Aging results in increased myelopoiesis, which is linked to the increased incidence of myeloid leukemias and production of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Here, we examined the contribution of plasma cells (PCs) to age-related increases in myelopoiesis, as PCs exhibit immune regulatory function and sequester in bone marrow (BM). PC number was increased in old BM, and they exhibited high expression of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines and pathogen sensors. Antibody-mediated depletion of PCs from old mice reduced the number of myeloid-biased hematopoietic stem cells and mature myeloid cells to levels in young animals, but lymphopoiesis was not rejuvenated, indicating that redundant mechanisms inhibit that process. PCs also regulated the production of inflammatory factors from BM stromal cells, and disruption of the PC-stromal cell circuitry with inhibitors of the cytokines IL-1 and TNF-α attenuated myelopoiesis in old mice. Thus, the age-related increase in myelopoiesis is driven by an inflammatory network orchestrated by PCs.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31303400	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303400	aging	-3234984575507976056

The M2 protein of influenza B (BM2) is a membrane-embedded tetrameric proton channel that is essential for the viral lifecycle. BM2 is a functional analog of AM2 but shares only 24% sequence identity for the transmembrane (TM) domain. The structure and function of AM2, which is targeted by two antiviral drugs, have been well characterized.

Exercise in cirrhosis of the liver is an emerging topic in hepatology. Despite the known benefits of exercise in the general population, there are currently few studies addressing that issue in relation to cirrhosis and more evidence is still needed. Even though some studies have reported a sharp, exercise-induced increase in the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), the opposite (a decrease in the HVPG) has been shown by recent data after an exercise program carried out for>14 weeks. In addition to that benefit, improvement has been described in the metabolic profile, quality of life, muscle mass, cardiopulmonary function, and nutritional status. Together, those features make exercise in cirrhosis a very attractive intervention. However, certain aspects must be taken into account before prescribing exercise in that population and they include cardiovascular risk, musculoskeletal disorders, and complications related to cirrhosis. After considering those factors, an individually tailored exercise program should be developed for each patient, according to the points stated above and the desired goal. Information about exercise-limiting factors, type of exercise prescribed, monitoring methods, and concomitant nutritional therapy is provided in the present review.	2019	spa	Review	Mexico	31262552	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31262552	Cirrhosis	9220445660318725468

Even though the diagnosis can be made based upon the patient’s clinical symptoms and the laboratory results in most cases, diagnostic imaging can play a role in the assessment of patients who don’t respond to medical therapy. Ultrasound and multidetector CT are useful imaging modalities in the evaluation of patients with both acute and chronic urologic infection such as either pyelonephritis or renal abscess. MDCT also plays a vital role in the evaluation of patients with symptomatic stone disease. Struvite stones or infection stones develop in patients with recurrent urinary tract infections. Potential complications can arise from chronic infection stones, such as chronic obstructive pyelonephritis, pyonephrosis, xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, and end-stage renal replacement lipomatosis. In this section, we discuss urologic infections such as pyelonephritis, pyonephrosis, renal abscess, pyelonephritis, emphysematous pyelonephritis, and renal tuberculosis as well as complications of infected renal stones.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314368	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314368	tuberculosis	-7891960098457323262

Molecular basis of disease	The good side of inflammation: Staphylococcus aureus proteins SpA and Sbi contribute to proper abscess formation and wound healing during skin and soft tissue infections.	Staphylococcus aureus is the most prominent cause of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) worldwide. Mortality associated with invasive SSTI is a major threat to public health considering the incidence of antibiotic resistant isolates in particular methicillin resistant S. aureus both in the hospital (HA-MRSA) and in the community (CA-MRSA). To overcome the increasing difficulties in the clinical management of SSTI due to MRSA, new prophylactic and therapeutic approaches are urgently needed and a preventive vaccine would be welcome. The rational design of an anti-S. aureus vaccine requires a deep knowledge of the role that the different bacterial virulence factors play according to the type of infection. In the present study, using a set of isogenic deficient mutants and their complemented strains we determined that the staphylococcal surface proteins SpA and Sbi play an important role in the induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the skin during SSTI. SpA and Sbi initiate signaling cascades that lead to the early recruitment of neutrophils, modulate their lifespan in the skin milieu and contribute to proper abscess formation and bacterial eradication. Moreover, the expression of SpA and Sbi appear critical for skin repair and wound healing. Thus, these results indicate that SpA and Sbi can promote immune responses in the skin that are beneficial for the host and therefore, should not be neutralized with vaccine formulations designed to prevent SSTI.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31299217	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299217	vaccine	-1852234953549915446

To date, systemic treatments, including hormone therapies or chemotherapy, are used at different stages of prostate cancer disease. Several types of complications can occur during systemic treatment in prostate cancer, depending on the therapeutic range. The most common with hormone therapy are fatigue, muscle loss, bone loss, high blood pressure and metabolic syndromes. For chemotherapy, the most significant risk is related to hematological toxicity, but peripheral neuropathies, mucositis, diarrhea and hypersensitivity reactions may also occur. The quality of the pre-treatment assessment and the rigorousness of patient follow-up make it possible to anticipate most of these events, to prevent them or to manage them at an early stage when they occur. The most important aspect is patient education, which involves comprehensive information and the implementation of supportive care as soon as the treatment is initiated. Specialized advice (e. g. cardiological or endocrinological) is recommended in the event of uncontrolled symptomatology. The resumption of treatment leading to a major complication should be the subject of a multidisciplinary discussion taking into account the severity of the event, its reversibility, the patient's life expectancy and the expected efficacy of the molecule.	2019	fre	Journal Article	France	31307630	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307630	Diarrhea	2032007496318616962

Diabetes mellitus (DM) was induced by streptozotocin (STZ). There were five groups: C1-control (physiological saline 1 ml/kg, i.p. one day), C2-control with daily physiological saline treatment (1 ml/kg, i.p. 28 days), DM-diabetes mellitus (STZ 100 mg/kg in physiological saline, i.p. one day), FA-folic acid (5 mg/kg in physiological saline, i.p. 28 days), and DM+FA-diabetes mellitus and folic acid group (STZ 100 mg/kg in physiological saline, i.p. one day, and folic acid 5 mg/kg in physiological saline, i.p. 28 days). After four weeks, animal hearts were isolated for measurement of enzyme activities, as well as for histomorphometry analyses. An elevated glucose level and a decreased insulin level were obtained in the DM group. SOD, CAT, and MDH activities were elevated in the DM group, while there was no difference in LDH activity among the groups. In all tested groups, four LDH and three MDH isoforms were detected in the heart tissue, but with differences in their relative activities among the groups. Left ventricular cardiomyocyte transversal diameters were significantly smaller in both diabetic groups. Folic acid treatment of diabetic rats induced a reduced glucose level and reduced CAT, SOD, and MDH activities and alleviated the decrease in cardiomyocyte diameters. In conclusion, increased activities of antioxidant enzymes and MDH may be the consequence of oxidative stress caused by DM. Administration of the folic acid has a protective effect since it leads to reduction in glycemia and activities of the certain examined enzymes in the rats with experimentally induced DM.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31308875	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308875	diabetes	5051167660880461112

"Telemedicine is defined as the remote delivery of clinical care services through audio-visual conferencing technology. A shortage of care practitioners combined with an aging population with disproportionately increasing care utilization patterns has created a ""perfect storm,"" which since the late 1990s has propelled telemedicine as a potential solution to bridge this supply/demand and access gap. In critical care approximately 20% of nonfederal adult intensive care unit (ICU) beds in the US today are supported by some form of tele-ICU coverage. The literature has shown with increasing clarity during the last decade that correct tele-ICU implementation improves outcomes and has the potential to significantly improve the financial performance of health care systems. As is often the case in technology-driven innovations, the legal and regulatory framework has been moving slower than the clinical adoption of this new care delivery model, which is true not just in critical care, but in other medical specialties as well. This 2-part series focuses on legal perspectives on telemedicine. The first part discusses legal and regulatory challenges of telemedicine in general, with a more in-depth focus on tele-ICU.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a promising intervention to prevent HIV acquisition, with benefits both to the individual and to population-level health. PrEP is an opportunity to complement ongoing public health efforts to eliminate HIV. For women, PrEP can also serve as a gateway to access sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services. Clinical efficacy of PrEP was initially reported in women using a 1% tenofovir vaginal gel in 2010, followed by an efficacy trial of oral PrEP using TDF/FTC in men who have sex with men (MSM). Since then, further trials have reported efficacy in oral PrEP containing tenofovir in women and heterosexual men, while the subsequent trials for women using tenofovir gel reported no efficacy, stemming from difficulties in achieving adequate adherence. In an effort to offer women additional choices to oral PrEP, alternative modalities are being tested in clinical research, including long-acting injectable formulations and intra-vaginal rings. In 2015, a meta-analysis of clinic trials and open-label extension studies led to the World Health Organization (WHO) strongly recommending the provision of oral PrEP containing tenofovir for any person at substantial risk of HIV infection, irrespective of gender or population group. Currently, PrEP services for women around the world, including those who are either pregnant or breastfeeding, remain limited. Outside sub-Saharan Africa, most PrEP programmes are focused on MSM. South Africa, Kenya, and the USA have the greatest utilization of oral PrEP by women. Yet, since 2012, of the estimated > 300,000 people globally who have initiated PrEP, a minority are women. In this narrative review, we examine the most recent literature on clinical and implementation PrEP research among women. We highlight the high burden of disease related to common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in women, and the opportunity to integrate PrEP and other HIV prevention services, STI case management, and family planning services, as part of a more robust package of SRH services. Raising awareness on PrEP amongst women and their healthcare providers, minimizing gaps in access, and ensuring adherence and persistence of PrEP during periods of risk are critical issues if PrEP can have a meaningful impact on reducing HIV incidence in women globally.	2019	eng	Journal Article	New Zealand	31309457	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309457	HIV	-8722526817358894474
799	799	24	Aging cell	PGC-1α, a potential therapeutic target against kidney aging.	Aging is defined as changes in an organism over time. The proportion of the aged population is markedly increasing worldwide. The kidney, as an essential organ with a high energy requirement, is one of the most susceptible organs to aging. It is involved in glucose metabolism via gluconeogenesis, glucose filtration and reabsorption, and glucose utilization. Proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) depend on lipid metabolism to meet the high demand for ATP. Recent studies have shown that aging-related kidney dysfunction is highly associated with metabolic changes in the kidney. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α), a transcriptional coactivator, plays a major role in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, peroxisomal biogenesis, and glucose and lipid metabolism. PGC-1α is abundant in tissues, including kidney PTECs, which demand high energy. Many in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that the activation of PGC-1α by genetic or pharmacological intervention prevents telomere shortening and aging-related changes in the skeletal muscle, heart, and brain. The activation of PGC-1α can also prevent kidney dysfunction in various kidney diseases. Therefore, a better understanding of the effect of PGC-1α activation in various organs on aging and kidney diseases may unveil a potential therapeutic strategy against kidney aging.	2019	eng	Review	England	31313501	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313501	aging	5165953265902526320

Low temperature limits the absolute humidity of air. Persistent exposure to dry air leads to airway desiccation and failure of the mucociliary system. The resultant physiologic and histopathologic changes that occur in the airway increase susceptibility to flu-causing pathogens.

Neuraminidase (NA) content is not standardized in current seasonal influenza vaccines; neither anti-NA antibodies (anti-NA Abs) are measured nor is it well-defined as a correlate of humoral protection. In this work, the presence of NA1 antibodies against classical A(H1N1) and A(H1N1) pdm09 subtypes was studied before and after vaccination with seasonal vaccines containing A/California/07/2009 strain (A(H1N1) pdm09 subtype). By Enzyme-Linked Lectin Assay (ELLA; Consortium for the Standardization of Influenza Seroepidemiology), we analyzed serum samples from two different cohorts (adults and elderly). The presence of anti-NA Abs at titers ≥1/40 against classical A(H1N1) and A(H1N1) pdm09 subtypes were frequently found in both age groups, in 81.3% and 96.3% of adults and elderly, respectively. The higher titers of anti-NA Abs (NAI titers) were detected more frequently against classical A(H1N1) strains according to the expected age when the first flu infection takes place. In this way, an Original Antigenic Sin phenomenon related to NA seems to be part of the immune response against flu. Seasonal-vaccination induced homologous seroconversion against NA of A(H1N1) pdm09 subtype in 52.5% and 55.0%, and increased the Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) in 70.0% and 78.8% of adults and elderly, respectively. Seasonal vaccination also induced a heterotypic anti-NA Abs response against classical A(H1N1) strains (seroconversion at least in 8.8% and 11.3% of adults and elderly, respectively, and an increase in GMTs of at least 28.0% in both age groups). These anti-NA Abs responses occur even though the seasonal vaccine does not contain a standardized amount of NA. This work demonstrates that seasonal vaccines containing the A(H1N1) pdm09 subtype induce a broad antibody response against NA1, that may be a target for future influenza vaccines. Our study is one of the first to analyze the presence of Abs against NA and the response mediated by NAI titers after seasonal influenza vaccination.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	30871198	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30871198	flu	163780025692404854

Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are common causes of respiratory tract infections and place a burden on health services each winter. Systems to describe the timing and intensity of such activity will improve the public health response and deployment of interventions to these pressures. Here we develop early warning and activity intensity thresholds for monitoring influenza and RSV using two novel data sources: general practitioner out-of-hours consultations (GP OOH) and telehealth calls (NHS 111). Moving Epidemic Method (MEM) thresholds were developed for winter 2017-2018. The NHS 111 cold/flu threshold was breached several weeks in advance of other systems. The NHS 111 RSV epidemic threshold was breached in week 41, in advance of RSV laboratory reporting. Combining the use of MEM thresholds with daily monitoring of NHS 111 and GP OOH syndromic surveillance systems provides the potential to alert to threshold breaches in real-time. An advantage of using thresholds across different health systems is the ability to capture a range of healthcare-seeking behaviour, which may reflect differences in disease severity. This study also provides a quantifiable measure of seasonal RSV activity, which contributes to our understanding of RSV activity in advance of the potential introduction of new RSV vaccines.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31063101	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063101	flu	2457939609972623332

"Epileptic seizures with postictal negative symptoms represent 20% of all suspected strokes and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of stroke in any patient presenting with an acute neurological deficit, mostly in absence of convulsions. Seizures may also occur at stroke onset, and the latter need to be promptly recognized in order to timely administer reperfusion therapies and reduce the risk of irreversible brain injury. Neuroimaging is essential in differentiating between postictal negative symptoms and deficits due to stroke. After the acute phase, poststroke seizures may worsen or cause the reappearance of neurological deficits and consciousness impairment; they can be also misinterpreted as stroke recurrence and lead to delayed treatment with antiepileptic drugs. It is mandatory to maintain a low threshold for suspecting epileptic seizures, and require appropriate electroencephalographic and neuroimaging investigations to promptly ascertain the etiology of any unexplained change in the neurological status and provide the most adequate treatment.

Latent TB infection (LTBI) in HIV patients, its treatment, and immunological recovery following highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) could interact and impact TB disease progression. We aim to examine the factors associated with LTBI and TB disease development among HIV patients. Longitudinal clinical and laboratory data were accessed from the largest HIV specialist clinic in Hong Kong, where HAART and yearly LTBI screening are routinely provided for HIV patients. Between 2002 and mid-2017, among 2079 HIV patients with 14119 person-years (PY) of follow-up, 32% of LTBI screened patients (n = 1740) were tested positive. The overall TB incidence was 1.26/100 PY from HIV diagnosis to HAART initiation, falling to 0.37/100 PY. A lower risk of TB disease progression was associated with local residence, Chinese ethnicity, negative baseline LTBI result, being on HAART, LTBI treatment, higher baseline CD4 and CD4/CD8 ratio. A positive test at baseline, but not subsequent testing results, was significantly associated with TB disease development. Baseline LTBI screening is an important strategy for identifying HIV patients at risk of TB disease progression. Routine repeat LTBI screening on an annual basis might not give additional benefits to patients on HAART with good immunological responses. Such practice should require re-evaluation.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31300686	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300686	HIV	-1917202688559171732

820	820	77	Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica	Downregulation of lncRNA AFAP1-AS1 by oridonin inhibits the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells.	Recent studies have demonstrated that the expression of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) AFAP1-AS1 in pancreatic cancer is negatively correlated with survival and prognosis. However, the effects of oridonin and lncRNA AFAP1-AS1 on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration of pancreatic cancer cells have not been fully elucidated. Surgery is the only potentially curative method for pancreatic cancer, but postoperative recurrence and metastasis are common. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of oridonin and lncRNA AFAP1-AS1 silencing on pancreatic cancer cells. The pancreatic cancer cell lines BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells were transfected with siAFAP1-AS1 and its negative control (siNC). After that, oridonin was used to treat the siAFAP1-AS1-transfected cells. The expression of lncRNA AFAP1-AS1 was downregulated in the pancreatic cancer cell lines BxPC-3 and PANC-1. The apoptosis and cell cycle progression of pancreatic cancer cells were evaluated by flow cytometry and Hoechst 33258 staining. Metastasis and invasion of BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells were detected by transwell migration assay, real-time cell analysis, and western blot analysis. Cells were transfected with the lentiviral siAFAP1-AS1 and siNC, and tumorigenesis was evaluated in BALB/C nude mice. Immunohistochemical examination was used to verify the effects of oridonin and siAFAP1-AS1 on pancreatic cancer. The results demonstrated that the combination of oridonin and siAFAP1-AS1 inhibited pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, arrested cell cycle progression, prevented the migration, regulated EMT-related protein expression in BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells, and inhibited pancreatic cancer cell tumorigenicity and EMT in nude mice.	2019	eng	Journal Article	China	31314060	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314060	cancer	-5522643017727334716

The study built upon previous research by utilizing in-depth interviews to encourage disclosure of potentially stigmatized topics. Twenty women veterans enrolled in VHA care engaged in a quality improvement project focused on improving smoking cessation services. Qualitative analysis of de-identified interviews used a combination of content analysis and thematic analysis within the sociopharmacological model of tobacco addiction. Findings revealed that participants' smoking was influenced by woman veteran identity and by several gender-related contextual factors, including military sexual trauma and gender discrimination. Findings also highlighted other contextual factors, such as personal autonomy, emotional smoking triggers, and chronic mental health concerns. Findings are interpreted within the context of cultural power imbalances, and recommendations are provided for VHA smoking cessation for women veterans.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31307290	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307290	smoking	-8615957592921855596

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the efficacy and safety of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (G/P) for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Scopus were searched to identify relevant studies through August 2018. Data from eligible studies were pooled and sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12) rates were calculated. Thirteen studies with 3082 patients were included and the overall SVR12 rate was 97.8%. The SVR12 rates of subgroups were: G/P 300/120 mg and 200/120 mg: 97.9% and 98.3%; HCV genotype (GT)1, GT2, GT3 and GT4-6: 99.8%, 99.2%, 96.1% and 100%; G/P and G/P plus ribavirin: 97.9% and 98.2%; G/P (300/120mg) for 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks: 98.8%, 98.5% and 95.6%; treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients: 96.7% and 98.3%; patients without and with compensated cirrhosis: 99.4% and 98.8%; patients without and with HIV co-infection: 97.8% and 99.4%; and patients without and with severe renal impairment: 97.8% and 99.4%. Virologic failure and relapse as well as serious drug-related adverse events were rare. These results suggest that 8- or 12-week G/P treatment achieved high SVR12 rates in HCV GTs 1-6 patients without or with compensated cirrhosis, with good safety profiles, irrespective of dose, ribavirin use, treatment-experience, HIV co-infection and renal impairment. Due to the limited number of evaluated patients with GT3 infection, further studies are needed to define optimal treatment duration for GT3 cirrhosis patients and patients with prior treatment experience of direct-acting antivirals.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31284039	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284039	Cirrhosis	8049667463017473012

The electrochemical behavior of indium in the ionic liquid trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium chloride (Cyphos IL 101) was studied. Cyphos IL 101 first had to be purified, as the impurities present in commercial Cyphos IL 101 interfered with the electrochemical measurements. Electrochemical deposition of indium metal from this electrolyte occurs without hydrogen evolution, increasing the cathodic current efficiency compared to deposition from water and avoiding porosity within the deposited metal. Indium(iii) is the most stable oxidation state in the ionic liquid. This ion is reduced in two steps, first from indium(iii) to indium(i) and subsequently to indium(0). The high thermal stability of Cyphos IL 101 allowed the electrodeposition of indium at 120 °C and 180 °C. At 180 °C indium was deposited as liquid indium which allows for the easy separation of the indium and the possibility to design a continuous electrowinning process. On molybdenum, indium deposits as liquid droplets even below the melting point of indium. This was explained by the combination of melting point depression and undercooling. The possibility to separate indium from iron and zinc by electrodeposition was tested. It is possible to separate indium from zinc by electrodeposition, but iron deposits together with indium.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31303860	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303860	depression	5979676385148714519

Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) is a leading cause of death and perpetual neurological dysfunction in neonates. Vanillin (Van), a natural phenolic compound with neuroprotective properties, exerts neuroprotection on a gerbil model of global ischemia by inhibiting oxidative damage. This study aimed to explore the potential neuroprotective roles of Van in neonatal rats suffering from hypoxic-ischemic (HI). An HI model of 7-day-old SD rats was induced by left carotid artery ligation followed by exposure to 8% oxygen (balanced with nitrogen) for 2.5 h at 37 °C. At 48 h after intraperitoneal injection with Van (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg) or saline, neurobehavioral function, cerebral infract volume, brain water content, and histomorphological changes were performed to evaluate brain injury. Transmission electron microscopy and immunoglobulin G (IgG) staining were conducted to evaluate the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The levels of oxidative stress and tight junction proteins, as well as the activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), were also determined in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Results showed that Van post-treatment significantly ameliorated early neurobehavioral deficits, decreased infarct volume and brain edema, as well as attenuated histopathologic injury and IgG extravasation. Furthermore, Van markedly increased the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and decreased malondialdehyde content. Meanwhile, the activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 induced by HI was partially blocked by Van. Finally, Van obviously increased the expression of ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-5 compared with the HI group. Collectively, Van can provide neuroprotective effects against neonatal HIBD possibly by attenuating oxidative damage and preserving BBB integrity.	2019	eng	Journal Article	France	31310955	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310955	stress	4716135688735489427

832	832	400	 	Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors in Regulation of Pathology of Cerebrovascular Disorders	Cerebrovascular disorders including ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage are among the major clinical concerns for which effective therapies are poorly available. Accumulating lines of evidence indicate that drugs acting on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) may provide therapeutic effects on these disorders, based on their neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory actions. For example, the cholinergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system via nAChRs may function as an endogenous neuroprotective system that prevents pathogenic events associated with ischemic stroke. On the other hand, exogenous administration of nicotine or nAChR agonists to experimental models of ischemic stroke has been reported to produce conflicting results (either protective or deleterious), which may be largely dependent on the different regiments of drug treatments. With regard to intracerebral hemorrhage, preclinical findings suggest that post-treatment with nAChR agonists is effective in alleviating brain tissue damage and neurological outcome. The beneficial actions of nAChR agonist have also been reported for an experimental model of subarachnoid hemorrhage, which should be confirmed by further investigations.

834	834	69	Frontiers in pharmacology	Carbonyl Reduction of Flubendazole in the Human Liver: Strict Stereospecificity, Sex Difference, Low Risk of Drug Interactions.	Flubendazole (FLU), an anthelmintic drug of benzimidazole type, is now considered a promising anti-cancer agent due to its tubulin binding ability and low system toxicity. The present study was aimed at determining more information about FLU reduction in human liver, because this information has been insufficient until now. Subcellular fractions from the liver of 12 human patients (6 male and 6 female patients) were used to study the stereospecificity, cellular localization, coenzyme preference, enzyme kinetics, and possible inter-individual or sex differences in FLU reduction. In addition, the risk of FLU interaction with other drugs was evaluated. Our study showed that FLU is predominantly reduced in cytosol, and the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) coenzyme is preferred. The strict stereospecificity of FLU carbonyl reduction was proven, and carbonyl reductase 1 was identified as the main enzyme of FLU reduction in the human liver. A higher reduction of FLU and a higher level of carbonyl reductase 1 protein were found in male patients than in female patients, but overall inter-individual variability was relatively low. Hepatic intrinsic clearance of FLU is very low, and FLU had no effect on doxorubicin carbonyl reduction in the liver and in cancer cells. All these results fill the gaps in the knowledge of FLU metabolism in human.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31191322	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191322	flu	-724699218170106849

836	836	297	Advances in immunology	The airway epithelium in asthma.	Asthma is a genetically and phenotypically complex disease that has a major impact on global health. Signs and symptoms of asthma are caused by the obstruction of airflow through the airways. The epithelium that lines the airways plays a major role in maintaining airway patency and in host defense. The epithelium initiates responses to inhaled or aspirated substances, including allergens, viruses, and bacteria, and epithelial-derived cytokines are important in the recruitment and activation of immune cells in the airway. Changes in the structure and function of the airway epithelium are a prominent feature of asthma. Approximately half of individuals with asthma have evidence of active type 2 immune responses in the airway. In these individuals, epithelial cytokines promote type 2 responses, and responses to type 2 cytokines result in increased epithelial mucus production and other effects that cause airway obstruction. Recent work also implicates other epithelial responses, including interleukin-17, interferon and ER stress responses, that may contribute to asthma pathogenesis and provide new targets for therapy.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31296301	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296301	asthma	357449794379078687

Overeating is a serious issue in modern society, causing many health problems, including obesity. Although the hypothalamus has been previously identified as the key brain structure that regulates body weight homeostasis, the downstream pathways and non-canonical neural circuitry involved in feeding behavior remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we discover that suppressing the activity of GABAergic cells in the anterior ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), whether directly or through long-projection GABAergic inputs from either the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) or the lateral hypothalamus (LH), is sufficient to promptly induce feeding behavior in well-fed mice. In contrast, optogenetic activation of these cells interrupts food intake in starved mice. Long-term chemogenetic manipulation of vlPAG GABAergic cell activity elicits a corresponding change in mouse body weight. Our studies reveal distinct midbrain GABAergic pathways and highlight an important role of GABAergic cells in the anterior vlPAG in feeding behavior.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31315042	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315042	obesity	-2118981143119783447

Dental education is a challenging experience that places significant demands on students' intellectual, financial, and psychosocial well-being. Dental students who simultaneously experience physical illness, emotional upset, or interpersonal difficulty may be at greater risk of experiencing negative academic consequences. It is well documented that stress affects student learning, however, the impact of other health concerns on academic success is less understood. The purpose of this manuscript is to document the prevalence and perceived academic impact of 24 health concerns on the academic performance of a sample of 130 undergraduate dental students as measured by the National College Health Assessment (NCHA). Health concerns that were most prevalent among dental students were generally also perceived to be most detrimental to their learning. These included upper respiratory infections (cold, flu, sore throat), interpersonal concerns (concerns about a troubled friend or family member, and relationship difficulty), and mental health issues (depression/anxiety/seasonal affective disorder, and stress).	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	30806191	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30806191	flu	8689098216946253326

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a high-incidence neurodegenerative disease with complex and diverse pathogenesis. With aging of the population and continuous improvement of living standards, the incidence of AD is on the increase. Therefore, there is need to develop more effective AD drugs in order to improve the quality of life of the elderly. Sakuranetin (SAK) is a dihydroflavonoid compound extracted from plants. It has many physiological properties. In this study, the effect of SAK on spatial discrimination in a rat model of cognitive dysfunction exposed to D-galactose was investigated with respect to its effect on malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels, and on the expressions of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and nuclear factor-κB inhibitory factor-α (IκBα) in hippocampus of rats. The results obtained suggest that SAK may exert protective effects on brain cells through anti-oxidation mechanism. Moreover, the improvement in learning and memory impairment by SAK may also be related to the inhibition of inflammatory mediators in brain tissue. These findings provide scientific evidence that can be exploited for more effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	2019	eng	Journal Article	France	31304907	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304907	aging	-4049108709890217048

Education in people's early lives are positively related to their cognitive function, but its modulating effects on detailed cognition domains, its interaction with leisure activities and the associated brain changes have yet to be investigated. This report used data from 659 cognitively normal community dwelling elderly who completed neuropsychological tests, leisure activities measurement, and 78 of them underwent structural and diffusion MRI scans. We found that: (i) the highly educated elderly had a better cognitive functioning in multi-domains, higher frequencies of participation in knowledge-related leisure activities, and slower age-related reductions of executive function; (ii) the intellectual and social types of leisure activities mediated the association between education and multiple cognitive domains, including memory, language, attention and executive function; (iii) there was a significant age by education interaction on the gray matter volume of the anterior brain regions and white matter integrity; and (iv) the interaction between age and education affected cognition indirectly through white matter integrity analyzed using structural equation model. Overall, our results revealed that high education in early life served as a protective factor in aging that may help to postpone cognitive and brain reserve decline in cognitively normal aging.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31315089	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315089	aging	3241240229241793423

"The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) emerged in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012 causing a critical challenge to public health. The epidemiology of MERS-CoV remain enigmatic as human-to-human transmission is not fully understood. One possible scenario that might play a role in the virus transmission is the cultural waterpipe smoking. Cafés providing waterpipe smoking in cities within Saudi Arabia have been moved to areas outside city limits that frequently place them close to camels markets. We report results of a surveillance study wherein waterpipe hoses throughout several regions in Saudi Arabia were tested for the presence of MERS-CoV. A total of 2489 waterpipe samples were collected from cities where MERS-CoV cases were continuously recorded. MERS-CoV RNA wasn't detected in collected samples. Irrespective of the negative results of our survey, the public health risk of waterpipe smoking should not be underestimated. To avoid a possible transmission within country where MERS-CoV is prevalent, we recommend the replacement of resusable hoses with ""one-time-use"" hoses in addition to a close inspection of waterpipe components to assure the appropriate cleaning and sanitization."	2019	eng	Journal Article	Saudi Arabia	31303822	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303822	smoking	2072448887839540892

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a well diagnosed disease, thoroughly attributed to series of symptoms criteria that embrace a broad range of abdominal complainers. Such criteria help to diagnosis the disease and can guide controlled clinical trials to seek new therapeutic agents. Accordingly, a verity of mechanisms and pathophysiological conditions including inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and different life styles are involved in IBS. Predictably, diverse therapeutic approaches are available and prescribed by clinicians due to major manifestations (i.e., diarrhea-predominance, constipation-predominance, abdominal pain and visceral hypersensitivity), psychological disturbances, and patient preferences between herbal treatments versus pharmacological therapies, dietary or microbiological approaches. Herein, we gathered the latest scientific data between 1973 and 2019 from databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus and Cochrane library on relevant studies concerning beneficial effects of herbal treatments for IBS, in particular polyphenols. This is concluded that polyphenols might be applicable for preventing IBS and improving the IBS symptoms, mainly through suppressing the inflammatory signaling pathways, which nowadays are known as novel platform for the IBS management.

Native right coronary artery (RCA) spasm is a less frequent early complication of perioperative coronary artery bypass grafting. Late presentation at 6 days postoperation is scarce and its relationship with an anomalous coronary artery is unknown. The optimal management and prevention remains controversial. In the case presented, the patient's anomalous left coronary artery originating from the right coronary cusp underwent ligation at its proximal segment at the time of bypass grafting. This ligation was preformed to prevent competitive flow. Six days postoperation, a refractory spasm of dominant native RCA occurred. The spasm resulted in right ventricular failure. Administration of intracoronary verapamil had a longer sustained vasodilatory effect and resolution of coronary spasm when compared with intracoronary nitroglycerine injection.

HDL-like particles in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) promote the efflux of cholesterol from astrocytes towards the neurons that rely on this supply for their functions. We evaluated whether cell cholesterol efflux capacity of CSF (CSF-CEC) is impaired in Alzheimer disease (AD), by analyzing AD (n = 37), non-AD dementia patients (non-AD DEM, n = 16) and control subjects (n = 39). As expected, AD patients showed reduced CSF Aβ 1-42, increased total- and phospho-Tau and higher frequency of apo Ɛ4 genotype. ABCA1- and ABCG1-mediated CSF-CEC was markedly reduced in AD (-73% and -33%, respectively) but not in non-AD DEM, in which a reduced passive diffusion CEC (-40%) was observed. Non-AD DEM patients displayed lower CSF apoE concentrations (-24%) compared to controls, while apoA-I levels were similar among groups. No differences in CSF-CEC were found by stratifying subjects for apo Ɛ4 status. ABCG1 CSF-CEC positively correlated with Aβ 1-42 (r = 0.305, p = 0.025) while ABCA1 CSF-CEC inversely correlated with total- and phospho-Tau (r = -0.348, p = 0.018 and r = -0.294, p = 0.048 respectively). The CSF-CEC impairment and the correlation with the neurobiochemical markers suggest a pathophysiological link between CSF HDL-like particle dysfunction and neurodegeneration in AD.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31167810	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31167810	Alzheimer	-8278633353687754322

Loss of cardiomyocytes during acute myocardial infarction is strongly associated with energetic changes and lipotoxic-induced apoptosis. Our aim was to study FNDC5/irisin potential protective role against hypoxia and lipotoxicity, both related with myocardial infarction environment. H9c2 cells were treated with palmitate and/or irisin in normoxic/hypoxic conditions. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by MTT assay and annexin V/PI staining. Immunoblotting was used to confirm apoptotic cascade regulation. Irisin counteracts lipotoxic-induced apoptosis in hypoxic cardiomyoblasts by activating Akt signalling pathway suggesting the potential therapeutic role of irisin in ischemic heart disease.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31284265	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284265	heart+disease	8402348887626635381

Patients with cancer in remission or with a favorable prognosis should be treated according to current cardiovascular guidelines. In these patients, aortic valve replacement can be performed either by surgery or transcatheter. Significant challenges arise in patients with active cancer, especially those receiving anti-cancer treatment. Recent data suggests that these patients can be offered aortic valve replacement, with a trend of favoring the transcatheter route in order to minimize perioperative risk and complications associated with major surgery.

We present here the case of a 55-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and respiratory distress secondary to mesenteric ischemia. His critical illness on preexisting chronic kidney disease, previously undiagnosed alcoholic cirrhosis, and congestive heart failure led to a rare yet fatal consequence of refractory hypoglycemia. Critical illness associated hypoglycemia generally occurs as a result of high metabolic consumption with relative insulin excess and insufficient nutritional intake that is seen frequently in critically ill patients. This, along with reduced hepatic and renal gluconeogenesis seen in preexisting liver and renal disease, can cumulate to life-threatening hypoglycemia and is seen as a poor prognostic factor in the ICU setting.	2019	eng	Case Reports	United States	31263604	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263604	Cirrhosis	-5464698687596686623
871	871	333	Legal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)	CLEIA of humor vitreous in a case of suicidal insulin overdose.	Insulin overdoses have been mostly described in literature as accidental and suicidal deaths, especially in diabetic patients. The present case study deals with a 68 years old male found dead in his bedroom. The victim worked as health care professional in a rescue team, suffering from depression for several years. At the death scene, two ampoules of soluble insulin were recovered close to the body, one of which was empty. At autopsy, no signs of trauma and no injection marks were found at common sub-cutaneous or intravenous injection sites. No other remarkable findings, but hemorrhagic pulmonary edema along with astrogliosis and neuronal degeneration/necrosis in the subcortical regions and corpus callosum were observed. The blood specimen was inadequate due to hemolysis, since it was not centrifugated soon after sampling. Biochemical analysis was performed on bilateral samples of vitreous humor by using electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLEIA). The insulin concentration was 61.11 mU/L in the right vitreous humor and 74.23 mU/L in the left one; the C-peptide concentration was 0.166 ng/mL in right vitreous and 0.157 ng/mL in the left one. The results are in agreement with levels of insulin and C-peptide detected in previous case studies. Based on these findings the cause of death was determined as suicidal insulin overdoses probably by sublingual administration. This way of self-administration was a diagnosis for exclusion as it has been demonstrated that sublingual human insulin has hypoglycemic effects similar to insulin injected. The case study emphasizes the potential role of vitreous humor as reliable alternative substrate for biochemical analysis compared to post-mortem serum or blood samples in cases of fatal insulin intoxication. Furthermore, the CLEIA is an encouraging analytical method to be considered in such cases, although still not validated to perform quantitative analysis of post-mortem fluids.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Ireland	31307009	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307009	depression	4563606877148407012

875	875	51	Experimental dermatology	Seborrheic Dermatitis - Looking beyond Malassezia.	Seborrheic Dermatitis (SD) is a very common chronic and/or relapsing inflammatory skin disorder whose pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Yeast of the genus Malassezia has long been regarded as a main predisposing factor, even though causal relationship has not been firmly established. Additional predisposing factors have been described, including sebaceous activity, host immunity (especially HIV infection), epidermal barrier integrity, skin microbiota, endocrine and neurologic factors, and environmental influences. Genetic studies in humans and mouse models-with particularly interesting insights from examining the Mpzl3 knockout mice and their SD-like skin phenotype, and patients carrying a ZNF750 mutation-highlight defects in host immunity, epidermal barrier and sebaceous activity. After synthesizing key evidence from the literature, we propose that intrinsic host factors, such as changes in the amount or composition of sebum and/or defective epidermal barrier, rather than Malassezia, may form the basis of SD pathobiology. We argue that these intrinsic changes provide favorable conditions for the commensal Malassezia to over-colonize and elicit host inflammatory response. Aberrant host immune activity or failure to clear skin microbes may bypass the initial epidermal or sebaceous abnormalities. We delineate specific future clinical investigations, complemented by studies in suitable SD animal models, that dissect the roles of different epidermal compartments and immune components as well as their crosstalk and interactions with the skin microbiota during the process of SD. This research perspective beyond the conventional Malassezia-centric view of SD pathogenesis is expected to enable the development of better therapeutic interventions for the management of recurrent SD.

Recent progress in immunotherapies created new hopes in the treatment of PDAC and extrahepatic BTC. Several trials tested immunotherapies in various therapeutic situations as monotherapies or in combinations. Although responses were seen in some of the trials, the value of immunotherapy in PDAC and extrahepatic BTC remains unclear in the current situation, especially regarding the complex biological characteristics with a high stroma component, intrinsic resistance mechanisms and an immunosuppressive, hypoxic microenvironment. These major hurdles have to be taken into account and overcome if immunotherapies should be successful in these tumor entities. Thereby, combinational approaches that allow on the one hand targeted therapy and on the other restore or boost the function of immune cells are promising.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31312647	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312647	cancer	5568089143939945595

The present study aimed to analyze age-related changes to motor coordination, balance, spinal cord oxidative biomarkers in 3-, 6-, 18-, 24-, and 30-month-old rats. The effects of low-intensity exercise on these parameters were also analyzed in 6-, 18-, and 24-month-old rats. Body weight, blood glucose, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were assessed for all rats. The soleus muscle weight/body weight ratio was used to estimate skeletal muscle mass loss. Body weight increased until 24 months; only 30-month-old rats exhibited decreased blood glucose and increased total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. The soleus muscle weight/body weight ratio increased until 18 months, followed by a small decrease in old rats. Exercise did not change any of these parameters. Stride length and step length increased from adult to middle age, but decreased at old age. Stride width increased while the sciatic functional index decreased in old rats. Performance in the balance beam test declined with age. While gait did not change, balance improved after exercise. Aging increased superoxide anion generation, hydrogen peroxide levels, total antioxidant capacity, and superoxide dismutase activity while total thiol decreased and lipid hydroperoxides did not change. Exercise did not significantly change this scenario. Thus, aging increased oxidative stress in the spinal cord, which may be associated with age-induced changes in gait and balance. Regular low-intensity exercise is a good alternative for improving age-induced changes in balance, while beneficial effects on gait and spinal cord oxidative biomarkers cannot be ruled out because of the small number of rats investigated (n=5 or 6/group).	2019	eng	Journal Article	Brazil	31314852	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314852	stress	4315784099325221836
887	887	93	Translational behavioral medicine	Care-paradigm shift promoting smoking cessation treatment among cancer center patients via a low-burden strategy, Electronic Health Record-Enabled Evidence-Based Smoking Cessation Treatment.	Tobacco smoking is an important risk factor for cancer incidence, an effect modifier for cancer treatment, and a negative prognostic factor for disease outcomes. Inadequate implementation of evidence-based smoking cessation treatment in cancer centers, a consequence of numerous patient-, provider-, and system-level barriers, contributes to tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. This study provides data for a paradigm shift from a frequently used specialist referral model to a point-of-care treatment model for tobacco use assessment and cessation treatment for outpatients at a large cancer center. The point-of-care model is enabled by a low-burden strategy, the Electronic Health Record-Enabled Evidence-Based Smoking Cessation Treatment program, which was implemented in the cancer center clinics on June 2, 2018. Five-month pre- and post-implementation data from the electronic health record (EHR) were analyzed. The percentage of cancer patients assessed for tobacco use significantly increased from 48% to 90% (z = 126.57, p < .001), the percentage of smokers referred for cessation counseling increased from 0.72% to 1.91% (z = 3.81, p < .001), and the percentage of smokers with cessation medication significantly increased from 3% to 17% (z = 17.20, p < .001). EHR functionalities may significantly address barriers to point-of-care treatment delivery, improving its consistent implementation and thereby increasing access to and quality of smoking cessation care for cancer center patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31313808	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313808	cancer	-3114161754347804356

Life sciences	Identification of hedgehog signaling as a potential oncogenic driver in an aggressive subclass of human hepatocellular carcinoma: A reanalysis of the TCGA cohort.	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a heterogeneous disease and the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Marked developments in genomic technologies helped scientists to understand the heterogeneity of HCC and identified multiple HCC-related molecular subclasses. An integrative analysis of genomic datasets including 196 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) group has recently reported a new HCC subclass, which contains three subgroups (iCluster1, iCluster2, and iCluster3). However, the transcriptional molecular characteristics underlying the iClusters have not been thoroughly investigated. Herein, we identified a more aggressive subset of HCC patients in the iCluster1, and re-clustered the TCGA samples into novel HCC subclasses referred to as aggressive (Ag), moderate-aggressive (M-Ag), and less-aggressive (L-Ag) subclasses. The Ag subclass had a greater predictive power than the TCGA iCluster1, and a higher level of alpha fetoprotein, microscopic vascular invasion, immune infiltration, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 mutation status, and a worse survival than M-Ag and L-Ag subclasses. Global transcriptomic analysis showed that activation of hedgehog signaling in the Ag subclass may play key roles in tumor development of aggressive HCC. GLI1, a key transcriptional regulator of hedgehog signaling upregulated in the Ag subclass, was correlated with poor prognosis of HCC, and may be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for Ag subclass HCC patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	China	31313086	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313086	cancer	5268351851132250

Alzheimer disease (AD) represents an oncoming epidemic that without an effective treatment promises to exact extraordinary human and financial burdens. Studies of pathogenesis are essential for defining targets for discovering disease-modifying treatments. Past studies of AD neuropathology provided valuable, albeit limited, insights. Nevertheless, building on these findings, recent studies have provided an increasingly rich harvest of genetic, molecular and cellular data that are creating unprecedented opportunities to both understand and treat AD. Among the most significant are those documenting the presence within the AD brain of toxic oligomeric species of Aβ and tau. Existing data support the view that such species can propagate and spread within neural circuits. To place these findings in context we first review the genetics and neuropathology of AD, including AD in Down syndrome (AD-DS). We detail studies that support the existence of toxic oligomeric species while noting the significant unanswered questions concerning their precise structures, the means by which they spread and undergo amplification and how they induce neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. We conclude by offering a speculative synthesis for how oligomers of Aβ and tau initiate and drive pathogenesis. While 100 years after Alzheimer's first report there is much still to learn about pathogenesis and the discovery of disease-modifying treatments, the application of new concepts and sophisticated new tools are poised to deliver important advances for combatting AD.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31293377	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293377	Alzheimer	-3980612444042641628

Osteoarthritis is a form of chronic joint inflammation caused by the deterioration of the joint cartilage, accompanied by chronic pain, lameness and stiffness, particularly after prolonged activity. Alternative treatments of canine osteoarthritis would be desirable and, recently nutraceuticals, have been proposed for this purpose. Twenty cross breed adult dogs affected by osteoarthritis were enrolled and equally divided into two groups (control vs. experimental). The nutritional supplement (Dynamopet srl, Verone, Italy) was administered for 90 days to the dogs of the experimental group in order to evaluate its metabolic and locomotor effects. All the clinical signs (lameness, pain on manipulation and palpation, range of motion and joint swelling) significantly (p < 0.01) improved during the trial as regards the experimental group. This group showed a significantly lower joint score than the control group (mean value 7.40 vs. 3.80). With regard to haematology, the mean corpuscular volume resulted significantly (p < 0.01) higher in the experimental group, i.e. alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol and triglycerides values decreased and were significantly (p < 0.01) lower than the control one, thus suggesting an improvement in bone remodelling and lipid metabolism. A decrease in the reactive oxygen metabolites and an increase in the biological antioxidant potential demonstrated an improvement in oxidative stress during the trial in the experimental group compare to the control group. Interleukins 6 decreased in the experimental group, while interleukins 10 resulted in the opposite trend. Moreover, the administration of up to 3 months of the studied supplement was well tolerated in the dogs and caused no adverse effects.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31313893	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313893	stress	-4050006690189978332

El caracter neurotropo del virus del dengue se ha confirmado en estudios epidemiologicos, series de casos y estudios histopatologicos. El rango de complicaciones neurologicas es del 5,6-14,6%, y son mas frecuentes en los serotipos 1 y 3. La encefalopatia es el sindrome neurologico mas comun (0,5-6%); su prevalencia es mayor en los niños y los adolescentes. La deteccion del antigeno viral en el tejido cerebral y la presencia de pleocitosis o ARN en el liquido cefalorraquideo son evidencia del caracter neurotropo del virus del dengue, que se manifiesta en forma de encefalitis. Los sindromes neurologicos durante la fase de convalecencia (encefalomielitis aguda diseminada, cerebelitis, opsoclonia-mioclonia, mononeuritis, polirradiculoneuritis y plexitis) parecen ser inmunomediados.

"Juvenile fibromyalgia (JFM) is a chronic pain syndrome with onset in developmental age, characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain associated with other neurological or nonneurological symptoms. Headache is one of the most frequent comorbid conditions with JFM, but this association is still poorly studied in the juvenile population. The literature review was conducted searching through PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science with a combination of the following free-text terms: ""fibromyalgia,"" ""juvenile fibromyalgia,"" ""headache,"" ""primary headache,"" ""migraine,"" ""children,"" ""adolescents,"" and ""comorbidity."" The research resulted only in two specific studies regarding comorbidity JFM + Juvenile Headache (JH). From each study, we extracted data about sample features, clinical characteristics of both JFM and PH, and assessment tools. The clinical approach to JFM and JH should include a complete examination of the main causes of comorbid diseases, thus improving the therapeutic approach to the patient in developmental age."	2019	eng	Review	United States	31281557	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31281557	headache	5088013394045185972

Intracranial artery dissection secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is far less common than cerebral aneurysm. A 55-year-old man presented a sudden onset of headache and disturbed consciousness caused by ischemic stroke in the bilateral frontal lobes with minor subarachnoid hemorrhage. The bilateral anterior cerebral arteries were firstly occluded and re-perfused with irregular narrowing and dilation in 3 days after stroke onset, indicating dissection. He was diagnosed with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease by abdominal CT findings and by his family history though his renal function was almost normal. Dissection in the anterior cerebral artery has not been reported previously, while some cases with dissection in the vertebral and extracranial arteries were reported in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. His family also had a history of aortic dissection and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intracranial artery dissection may be a manifestation of systemic arteriopathy with familial clustering in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.

Our previous finding demonstrated that chronic corticosterone (CORT) may be involved in mediating the pathophysiology of premature aging in rats. Frequent jet lag increases the risk for many diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, and is associated with the aging processes. However, the effect of jet lag on CORT-induced depression and its association with aging phenotypes remain unclear. In this study, the rats were exposed to both CORT and jet lag treatment, and the differences were analyzed and compared to rats with single CORT treatment. Our results showed that jet lag treatment aggravated CORT-induced depression-like behavior evidenced by sucrose intake test, forced swimming test, and open field test. Additionally, this treatment aggravated the shortening of telomeres, which possibly resulted in decreased telomerase activity, and downregulated the expression of telomere-binding factor 2 (TRF2) and telomerase reverse transcriptase compared to that in CORT rats, as revealed by quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. The shortening of telomeres may have been caused by increased oxidative stress, which was associated with the inhibition of sirtuin 3. Exposure to jet lag also aggravated the degeneration of mitochondrial functions, as shown by the decreases in the mRNA expression of COX1, ND1, and Tfam. Our findings provide physiological evidence that jet lag exposure may worsen stress-induced depression and age-related abnormalities.	2019	eng	Journal Article	China	31314053	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314053	obesity	-9073210245497295284

This study aimed to determine the efficacy of mindfulness practice on emotional state and cognitive function of community-living elderly with mild cognitive impairment. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with the experimental group undergoing a Mindfulness Awareness Program (MAP) and an active control group undergoing a Health Education Program (HEP) over a nine month period. Sessions were conducted weekly for the first three months and monthly for the remaining six months. Self-reported questionnaires in English and Chinese were administered through face-to-face interviews to collect data at baseline, three months and nine months. Descriptive statistics and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to analyse data. Fifty-five elderly participants aged sixty and above, were randomized to MAP (N = 28) and HEP (N = 27) programs. Participants in both intervention arms experienced decreases in depressive and anxiety symptoms over the nine-month period. A significant improvement occurred in the HEP group in depression scores at three months and anxiety scores at both three and nine months. There were no statistically significant changes on cognitive function in both groups over the nine-month period. Both the MAP and HEP can benefit the emotional states of community-living elderly with mild cognitive impairment. Our study supports the usefulness of group-based HEP as a low cost intervention for promoting active aging and psychological health in a community setting.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Scotland	31303397	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303397	depression	-1114438937697017987

Based on the clinical findings and animal models studies, involvement of chitinases has been suggested in several respiratory system diseases including asthma, COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Exploration of structure-activity relationships within the series of 1-(3-amino-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)-piperidin-4-amines, that was earlier identified as a scaffold of potent AMCase inhibitors, led us to discovery of highly active dual (i.e. AMCase and CHIT1) inhibitors with very good pharmacokinetic properties. Among them, compound 30 was shown to reduce the total number of cells in bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid (BALf) of mice challenged with house dust mite (HDM) extract after oral administration (50 mg/kg, qd).

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is emerging as a major threat to healthy aging among people with HIV (PHIV). PHIV face heightened risks for coronary heart disease (CHD)/myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF), fueled by systemic immune activation and by metabolic dysregulation. Women with HIV (WHIV) evidence unique patterns of vascular and myocardial pathology as compared to men with HIV (MHIV). These patterns include a predilection to microvascular dysfunction and type II MI, as well as a penchant for diastolic dysfunction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Investigations are underway to understand how advanced reproductive aging among WHIV influences systemic immune activation and metabolic dysregulation en route to these CVD phenotypes. A key goal is to identify targeted CVD prevention strategies relevant to WHIV, particularly as efficacious treatment approaches to type II MI and HFpEF are lacking.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31309321	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309321	HIV	3548262914600772288

To compare the efficacy of drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization combined with radiofrequency ablation (DEB-TACE+RFA) versus DEB-TACE alone in Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.The 28 patients receiving DEB-TACE+RFA and 74 HCC patients receiving DEB-TACE were recruited in this study. Treatment responses, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated.One to 3 months after treatments, the proportion of patients achieving complete response (CR) (78.6% vs 33.8%, P <.001) and objective response rate (ORR) (92.9% vs 78.4%, P =.010) were elevated in DEB-TACE+RFA group compared with DEB-TACE group. Multivariate logistic regression displayed that DEB-TACE+RFA was an independently predicting factor for better CR (P = .006). Subgroup analysis of CR achievement illuminated that DEB-TACE+RFA disclosed better CR achievement in patients with history of cirrhosis (P <.001), tumor located in right liver (P = .003), bilobar disease (P = .013), tumor size <3.3 cm (P = .001), no portal vein invasion (P = .001), no hepatic vein invasion (P <.001), Child-pugh stage A (P <.001), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0, A-B (P <.001), abnormal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (P = .001) and normal AFP (P = .016).

The selective formation of nanomedicines around cancer cells is very important for cancer therapy because it increases the inhibitory capacity and decreases the systemic toxicity. However, successful examples are rare. Taking advantage of the overexpression of both the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the cell membrane receptor (CCK2R), we demonstrated in this study the selective formation of supramolecular nanofibers and hydrogels in the pericellular space of two cancer cell lines (HeLa and HepG2 cells). Both cell lines showed high expression levels of extracellular ALP and membrane-bound CCK2R. ALP efficiently converted Comp. 1 to a self-assembling molecule (Comp. 2). Comp. 2 interacted with CCK2R, thereby facilitating the self-assembly and formation of hydrogels around the cancer cells. The selective pericellular hydrogelations efficiently inhibited cancer cells. Pericellular hydrogelation around cancer cells is a promising strategy to control the formation of nanomedicines spatiotemporally in cellular microenvironments for cancer therapy and diagnostics.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31314031	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314031	cancer	-6858240061363309239

926	926	159	NeuroImage	Default-mode network activation underlies accurate contextual processing of exclusive disjunctions in older but not younger adults.	Young adults proactively engage frontoparietal processing of contextual cues to preempt subsequent events. Rather than being preemptive, older adults engage these brain areas reactively upon event occurrences. Reactive frontoparietal processes in older adults, however, might be insufficient for complex contextual neural computations where utilities of contexts are not straightforward but dependent on a set of stimulus-response rules. Applying non-linear logic (XOR) rules in an fMRI experiment, we found higher default-mode network (DMN) activity critical for correctly responding to such contingency in older but not younger adults. Moreover, older individuals with higher proactive cue processing showed better performances with less DMN activity. Thus, DMN processing provides critical support when older adults are faced with complex contextual contingencies. These findings suggest an age-related change in the neurocomputational role of introspective processes in decision-making from young to older adulthood.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31302255	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302255	aging	-1151034582628982912

Ultrasound is routinely used during the evaluation of liver cirrhosis. Inter-observer variability is considered a major drawback. This retrospective study investigated the accuracy of ultrasound in diagnosing compensated cirrhosis (i.e., modified Knodell F3, F4) in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients in real world clinical practice. Consecutive treatment-naive CHC patients who underwent liver biopsy (LB) prior to interferon therapy from 1997 to 2010 were enrolled. Ultrasound was performed by 30 hepatologists prior to LB. Ultrasound-identified cirrhosis was defined as small liver size, nodular liver surface and coarse liver parenchyma. LB was used as a reference, and the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound was assessed and compared. Fibrosis was scored according to the modified Knodell classification. A cohort comprising 1738 patients, including 922 men and 816 women with a mean age of 52.5 years, was analyzed in the present study. The distribution of the patients' modified Knodell scores was F0 = 336, F1 = 489, F2 = 165, F3 = 315, F4 = 433. Ultrasound-identified cirrhosis was noted in 283 patients. Using ultrasound-identified cirrhosis to predict compensated cirrhosis, the sensitivity was 34.0%, the specificity was 97.1%, the positive predictive value was 89.8%, the negative predictive value was 66.1%, the positive likelihood ratio was 11.6, and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.68. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was 0.66.Despite being affected by inter-observer variability, ultrasound is highly specific in diagnosing compensated cirrhosis in CHC patients in real world clinical practice. However, the sensitivity is low.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31277150	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31277150	Cirrhosis	-4233177915193302509

The VH1-2 restricted VRC01-class of antibodies targeting the HIV envelope CD4 binding site are a major focus of HIV vaccine strategies. However, a detailed analysis of VRC01-class antibody development has been limited by the rare nature of these responses during natural infection and the lack of longitudinal sampling of such responses. To inform vaccine strategies, we mapped the development of a VRC01-class antibody lineage (PCIN63) in the subtype C infected IAVI Protocol C neutralizer PC063. PCIN63 monoclonal antibodies had the hallmark VRC01-class features and demonstrated neutralization breadth similar to the prototype VRC01 antibody, but were 2- to 3-fold less mutated. Maturation occurred rapidly within ∼24 months of emergence of the lineage and somatic hypermutations accumulated at key contact residues. This longitudinal study of broadly neutralizing VRC01-class antibody lineage reveals early binding to the N276-glycan during affinity maturation, which may have implications for vaccine design.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31315032	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315032	vaccine	1031060816592502094
936	936	10	PloS one	Changes in cecal microbiota community of suckling piglets infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus.	"Diarrhea, caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), is a catastrophic gastrointestinal disease among suckling piglets, with high infectivity, morbidity, and mortality, causing huge economic losses to the pig industry. In the present study, we investigated the different microbiota from the cecal mucosa and cecal contents between healthy and PEDV-infected piglets. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to explore differences. The results revealed that microbial dysbiosis by PEDV infection occurred in the cecal mucosa and contents of suckling piglets at each microbial taxonomic level. The abundance of pathogenic bacteria associated with diseases, including diarrhea, was increased. The abundance of Fusobacterium was 26.71% and 33.91% in cecal mucosa and contents of PEDV-infected group, respectively, whereas that in the healthy groups was 17.85% and 9.88%. The proportion of Proteobacteria in the infected groups was relatively high (24.67% and 22.79%, respectively), whereas that in the healthy group was 13.13% and 11.34% in the cecal mucosa and contents, respectively. Additionally, the proportion of Bacteroidetes in the healthy group (29.89%, 37.32%) was approximately twice that of the PEDV-infected group (15.50%, 15.39%). ""Nitrate reduction"", ""Human pathogens diarrhea"", ""Human pathogens gastroenteritis"", ""Nitrite respiration"", and ""Nitrite ammonification"" were the enriched functional annotation terms in the PEDV-infected groups. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection increased the proportion of harmful bacteria and decreased the proportion of beneficial bacteria in the cecal mucosa and contents of suckling piglets. Our findings suggest that determining the intestinal microbiota might provide a promising method to prevent PEDV and open a new avenue for future research."	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31310635	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310635	Diarrhea	-2429242279408079104

WRKY transcription factors are key regulators in regulating abiotic or biotic stress response in Arabidopsis. Previous studies showed that WRKY30 expression was induced by oxidative stress treatment, fungal elicitor, SA and ABA. However, functions of WRKY30 on viral defense are not well studied. Here, we found that Arabidopsis WRKY DNA binding protein 30 (WRKY30) plays essential roles in regulating Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) resistance. The expression of WRKY30 was induced by CMV infection and wrky30 mutant displayed more susceptibility (including higher oxidative damages, induced reactive oxygen species synthesis and more PSII photochemistry compromise), while WRKY30 overexpression plants (WRKY30OX) exhibited more resistance to CMV infection. Moreover BRs-induced CMV tolerance is partly dependent on WRKY30. And WRKY30 expression increased after BL treatment. All these demonstrated that WRKY30 works as a positive regulator in plant CMV resistance process.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31311650	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311650	stress	-5043294260151549400

RNA-cleaving DNAzymes are useful tools for intracellular metal ion sensing and gene regulation. Incorporating stimuli-responsive modifications into these DNAzymes enables their activities to be spatiotemporally and chemically controlled for more precise applications. Despite the successful development of many 'caged' DNAzymes for light-induced activation, DNAzymes that are intracellularly activable by chemical inputs of biological importance, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), are still scarce. ROS like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hypochlorite (HClO) are critical mediators of oxidative stress-related cell signaling and dysregulation including activation of immune system as well as progression of diseases and aging. Using DNAzymes to study ROS-related cellular process requires ROS-activable DNAzymes to avoid the signals from cellular background events. In this work, we constructed ROS-activable DNAzymes by introducing phenylboronate and phosphorothioate modifications to the Zn2+-dependent 8-17 DNAzyme. These ROS-activable DNAzymes were orthogonally activated by H2O2 and HClO inside live human and mouse cells.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31314942	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314942	aging	-1480913447590268358

945	945	725	Human molecular genetics	Somatic mutation that affects transcription factor binding upstream of CD55 in the temporal cortex of a late-onset Alzheimer disease patient.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Familial cases suggest genetic components; however, monogenetic causes are few, and the vast majority of incidences have unknown cause. Sequencing efforts have focused on germline mutations, but improved technology has opened up for studies on somatic mutations in affected brain tissue samples. Here we use ultra-deep sequencing on brain and blood from early-onset AD (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD) patients and non-AD individuals (n = 16). In total, 2.86 Mb of genomic regions, previously associated with AD, were targeted included 28 genes and upstream and downstream regulatory regions. Tailored downstream bioinformatics filtering identified 11 somatic single nucleotide variants in the temporal cortex in AD patients and none in the controls. One variant was validated to be present at 0.4% allele frequency in temporal cortex of a LOAD patient. This variant was predicted to affect transcription factor binding sites upstream of the CD55 gene, contributing to AD pathogenesis by affecting the complement system. Our results suggest that future studies targeting larger portions of the genome for somatic mutation analysis are important to obtain an increased understanding for the molecular basis of both EOAD and LOAD.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31216356	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216356	Alzheimer	2841458704671711663
946	946	249	The American journal of case reports	Clinical Overlap Between Myopericarditis and Stress Induced Cardiomyopathy: A Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenge.	BACKGROUND Stress induced cardiomyopathy (SIC) is characterized by non-obstructive coronary arteries and characteristic ventricular apical ballooning. The exact pathogenesis of SIC is not well recognized. We present an unusual case of SIC that mimicked acute myopericarditis and discuss the effect of this masquerading presentation of SIC in recognizing pathophysiological association between myopericarditis and SIC and limitations of current diagnostic criteria. CASE REPORT A 47-year-old female presented with flu-like illness and pleuritic chest pain. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed diffuse PR depressions and ST elevations, troponin 5 ng/mL, hemoglobin 14.2 mg/dL, leukocytosis (white blood cell count of 15.1×103/uL) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 22.4 mm/hour. Echocardiogram showed reduced ejection fraction (EF) with apical ballooning. Catheterization showed non-obstructive coronary disease. The patient was given colchicine and ibuprofen for 1 day with symptom resolution over the next 2 days and repeat echocardiogram with preserved EF. Troponin trended down to 3.24 ng/mL and 0.44 ng/mL, 6 hours apart. ECG showed resolution of PR depressions and subsequent T wave inversions in 1, AVl, V1-V6 by day 3. The diagnosis of myopericarditis was favored by viral prodrome, fever, pleuritic pain, pericardial rub, ECG findings, and elevated ESR. History of emotional stress, characteristic ballooning of left ventricle apex with rapid resolution favored SIC. CONCLUSIONS This case showed that SIC and myocarditis need not be mutually exclusive and differentiating clinically between these 2 entities can be difficult. Alternatively, SIC can accompany other cardiac conditions like myocardial infarction, pericarditis, and myocarditis making diagnosis and management challenging. Clinicians need to be cautious while making this differentiation as duration and type of therapy may be significantly different. SIC can be considered a variant of regional inflammatory myocarditis wherein pericarditis may result secondary to extension of myocardial inflammation to overlying pericardium. The current Mayo Clinic criteria for diagnosis of SIC appears to be outdated, not accounting for such atypical presentations, and therefore needs to be revised.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	30804319	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804319	flu	2259988589066296676

Perianal symptoms occur in up to 50% of patients with Crohn's disease in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, and in 5% of patients it is the first manifestation of the disease. The perianal area is often under stress in patients with Crohn's disease, because of the diarrhea, and the fecal urgency, frequency, and incontinence caused by proximal disease. Symptomatic perianal disease can therefore be due to the effects of the stress on an otherwise normal anus, or the result of Crohn's disease in the low rectum and/or perianal tissues themselves. This key distinction should drive the investigation and management of anal and perianal symptoms in patients with Crohn's disease.

954	954	97	Nature microbiology	Direct interaction of whole-inactivated influenza A and pneumococcal vaccines enhances influenza-specific immunity.	The upper respiratory tract is continuously exposed to a vast array of potentially pathogenic viruses and bacteria. Influenza A virus (IAV) has particular synergism with the commensal bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae in this niche, and co-infection exacerbates pathogenicity and causes significant mortality. However, it is not known whether this synergism is associated with a direct interaction between the two pathogens. We have previously reported that co-administration of a whole-inactivated IAV vaccine (γ-Flu) with a whole-inactivated pneumococcal vaccine (γ-PN) enhances pneumococcal-specific responses. In this study, we show that mucosal co-administration of γ-Flu and γ-PN similarly augments IAV-specific immunity, particularly tissue-resident memory cell responses in the lung. In addition, our in vitro analysis revealed that S. pneumoniae directly interacts with both γ-Flu and with live IAV, facilitating increased uptake by macrophages as well as increased infection of epithelial cells by IAV. These observations provide an additional explanation for the synergistic pathogenicity of IAV and S. pneumoniae, as well as heralding the prospect of exploiting the phenomenon to develop better vaccine strategies for both pathogens.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31110357	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31110357	flu	-6644942243927487010

957	957	624	Neuroscience	Early life stress amplifies fear responses and hippocampal synaptic potentiation in the APPswe/PS1dE9 Alzheimer mouse model.	Cognitive deficits and alterations in emotional behaviour are typical features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, exposure to stress or adversity during the early life period has been associated with an acceleration of cognitive deficits and increased AD pathology in transgenic AD mouse models. Whether and how early life adversity affects fear memory in AD mice remains elusive. We therefore investigated whether exposure to early life stress (ELS) alters fear learning in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, a classic mouse model for AD, and whether this is accompanied by alterations in hippocampal synaptic potentiation, an important cellular substrate for learning and memory. Transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 mice were subjected to ELS by housing the dams and her pups with limited nesting and bedding material from postnatal days 2-9. Following a fear conditioning paradigm, 12-month-old ELS-exposed APPswe/PS1dE9 mice displayed enhanced contextual freezing behaviour, both in the conditioning context and in a novel context. ELS-exposed APPswe/PS1dE9 mice also displayed enhanced hippocampal synaptic potentiation, even in the presence of the GluN2B antagonist Ro25-6981 (which prevented synaptic potentiation in control mice). No differences in the level of PSD-95 or synaptophysin were observed between the groups. We conclude that in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, ELS increases fear memory in the conditioning context as well as a novel context, which is accompanied by aberrant hippocampal synaptic potentiation. These results may help to understand how individual differences in the vulnerability to develop AD arise and emphasise the importance of the early postnatal time window in these differences.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31302265	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302265	Alzheimer	-6184570078369383337

960	960	463	Vascular health and risk management	The burden of critical limb ischemia: a review of recent literature.	Peripheral arterial disease is a chronic vascular disease characterized by impaired circulation to the lower extremities. Its most severe stage, known as critical limb ischemia (CLI), puts patients at an increased risk of cardiovascular events, amputation, and death. The objective of this literature review is to describe the burden of disease across a comprehensive set of domains-epidemiologic, clinical, humanistic, and economic-focusing on key studies published in the last decade. CLI prevalence in the United States is estimated to be approximately 2 million and is likely to rise in the coming years given trends in important risk factors such as age, diabetes, and smoking. Hospitalization for CLI patients is common and up to 60% are readmitted within 6 months. Amputation rates are unacceptably high with a disproportionate risk for certain demographic and socioeconomic groups. In addition to limb loss, CLI patients also have reduced life expectancy with mortality typically exceeding 50% by 5 years. Given the poor clinical prognosis, it is unsurprising that the quality of life burden associated with CLI is significant. Studies assessing quality of life in CLI patients have used a variety of generic and disease-specific measures and all document a substantial impact of the disease on the patient's physical, social, and emotional health status compared to population norms. Finally, the poor clinical outcomes and increased medical resource use lead to a considerable economic burden for national health care systems. However, published cost studies are not comprehensive and, therefore, likely underestimate the true economic impact of CLI. Our summary documents a sobering assessment of CLI burden-a poor clinical prognosis translating into diminished quality of life and high costs for millions of patients. Continued prevention efforts and improved treatment strategies are the key to ameliorating the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.	2019	eng	Journal Article	New Zealand	31308682	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308682	smoking	-4793380646045599184

There are several immunological and clinical factors which determine the clinical efficacy and safety of the HBV vaccine. In this article we have highlighted the response of the host immune system to HBV vaccination (immunogenicity), efficacy, and safety of the vaccine, issues with booster dosing, paths of development (preclinical and clinical) of the HBV vaccine, novel and upcoming strategies for improvement of HBV vaccination, and the concept of therapeutic HBV vaccination. The different aspects and regulatory recommendations pertaining to HBV vaccine development are also discussed. The new strategies for improvement of HBV vaccination include pre-S1 and pre-S2 portions of the HBV surface antigen, increasing the antigen dose, accelerated vaccination schedules, alternative vaccination route, use of adjuvants like immunostimulatory DNA sequences, etc. Therapeutic vaccination is being explored for initiation of a multifunctional and multispecific T cell response against the major HBV antigens and also effective activation of humoral immunity for viral control.	2019	eng	Review	China	31293917	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293917	vaccine	4812089894709919859

Upregulation of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) was found to be associated with unfavorable prognosis and resistance to treatment in a broad spectrum of malignancies, recently also in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL). As demonstrated, variable CAIX expression in a significant number of cHL cases was associated with poor treatment response. The current study focused on the quantification CAIX immunopositivity and its relative expression compared to the total CD30+ neoplastic pool using digital image analysis. One hundred and one lymph node samples featuring cHL histology were analyzed for both CD30 and CAIX by immunohistochemistry. Whole histological slides were scanned and immunopositivity was determined as the histoscore (H-score) using the DensitoQuant software module (3DHistech Kft., Budapest, Hungary). CAIX positivity was observed in the HRS-cells of 56/101 cases (55.44%) and frequently observed in the proximity of necrotic foci. CAIX H-scores were highly variable (range: 2.16-90.36, mean 18.7 ± 18.8). Individual CAIX values were independent of the much higher CD30 values (range 3.46-151.3, mean 52.37 ± 30.74). The CAIX/CD30 index proved to be the highest in the aggressive lymphocyte-depleted (LD) subtype (CAIX/CD30: 0.876). The CAIX expression and the CAIX/CD30 relative index can be precisely determined by image analysis, and values reflect the extent of a tumor mass undergoing hypoxic-stress-related adaptation in the most aggressive forms of cHL.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31311071	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311071	stress	-3400154175330058574

Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), the primary risk factor for glaucoma, is thought to induce abnormally high strains in optic nerve head (ONH) tissues, which ultimately result in retinal ganglion cell damage and vision loss. The mechanisms by which excessive deformations result in vision loss remain incompletely understood. The ability of computational and in vitro models of the ONH to provide insight into these mechanisms, in many cases, depends on our ability to replicate the physiological environment, which in turn requires knowledge of tissue biomechanical properties. The majority of mechanical data published to date regarding the ONH has been obtained from tensile testing, yet compression has been shown to be the main mode of deformation in the ONH under elevated IOP. We have thus tested pig and rat ONH tissue using unconfined cyclic compression.

Cytosolic arginine sensor for mTORC1 subunits 1 and 2 (CASTOR1 and CASTOR2) inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) upon arginine deprivation. mTORC1 regulates cell proliferation, survival, and metabolism and is often dysregulated in cancers, indicating that cancer cells may regulate CASTOR1 and CASTOR2 to control mTORC1 signaling and promote tumorigenesis. mTORC1 is the most effective therapeutic target of Kaposi sarcoma, which is caused by infection with the Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Hence, KSHV-induced cellular transformation is a suitable model for investigating mTORC1 regulation in cancer cells. Currently, the mechanism of KSHV activation of mTORC1 in KSHV-induced cancers remains unclear. We showed that KSHV suppressed CASTOR1 and CASTOR2 expression to activate the mTORC1 pathway. CASTOR1 or CASTOR2 overexpression and mTOR inhibitors abolished cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar of KSHV-transformed cells by attenuating mTORC1 activation. Furthermore, the KSHV-encoded miRNA miR-K4-5p, and probably miR-K1-5p, directly targeted CASTOR1 to inhibit its expression. Knockdown of miR-K1-5p and -K4-5p restored CASTOR1 expression and thereby attenuated mTORC1 activation. Overexpression of CASTOR1 or CASTOR2 and mTOR inhibitors abolished the activation of mTORC1 and growth transformation induced by pre-miR-K1 and -K4. Our results define the mechanism of KSHV activation of the mTORC1 pathway and establish the scientific basis for targeting this pathway to treat KSHV-associated cancers.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31305263	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305263	HIV	-4265002939801511319
971	971	225	Allergy	Mechanisms and therapeutic strategies for Non-T2 Asthma.	Non T2 asthma is traditionally defined as asthma without features of T2 asthma. The definition is arbitrary, and is generally based on the presence of neutrophils in sputum, or the absence (or normal levels) of eosinophils or other T2 markers in sputum (pauci-granulocytic), airway biopsies or in blood. This definition may be imprecise as we gain more knowledge from applying transcriptomics and proteomics to blood and airway samples. The prevalence of non-T2 asthma is also difficult to estimate as most studies are cross-sectional and influenced by concomitant treatment with glucocorticosteroids, and by the presence of recognized or unrecognized airway infections. No specific therapies have shown any clinical benefits in patients with asthma that is associated with a non-T2 inflammatory process. It remains to be seen if such an endotype truly exists and to identify treatments to target that endotype. Meanwhile, identifying intense airway neutrophilia as an indicator of airway infection and airway hyperresponsiveness as an indicator of smooth muscle dysfunction, and treating them appropriately, and not increasing glucocorticosteroids in patients who do not have obvious T2 inflammation, seem reasonable.

Young Asian American women have high rates of depression and suicidality; however, few interventions address the urgent need for culturally informed care. Asian Women's Action for Resilience and Empowerment (AWARE) aims to be the first gender and culturally specific group psychotherapy intervention designed to improve mental and sexual health in Asian American women with trauma. This article specifically focuses on identifying the mechanisms of action that were responsible for improving mental health and well-being among those who participated in AWARE randomized controlled trial. Of the 435 women screened for the study, 63 Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese women with histories of interpersonal violence were randomized into either the intervention (n = 32) or waitlist control groups (n = 31). Data from 16 posttrial focus group sessions were then thematically analyzed to explore the key themes and mechanisms of action of the AWARE intervention. Analysis revealed four cultural mechanisms that facilitated mental health improvements: psychoeducation on disempowering parenting, the reduction of mental illness-related stigma, community and relational building, and a heightened sense of empowerment. Results suggest that the AWARE intervention fosters Asian American women's well-being on an individual level and encourages social engagement through culturally salient messages. Women in the study were able to expand their social support network, engage in activism, and develop an empowered connection to their community.

In the past few decades, there has been rapid growth in quantity and variety of healthcare data. These large sets of data are usually high dimensional (e.g. patients, their diagnoses, and medications to treat their diagnoses) and cannot be adequately represented as matrices. Thus, many existing algorithms can not analyze them. To accommodate these high dimensional data, tensor factorization, which can be viewed as a higher-order extension of methods like PCA, has attracted much attention and emerged as a promising solution. However, tensor factorization is a computationally expensive task, and existing methods developed to factor large tensors are not flexible enough for real-world situations. To address this scaling problem more efficiently, we introduce SGranite, a distributed, scalable, and sparse tensor factorization method fit through stochastic gradient descent. SGranite offers three contributions: (1) Scalability: it employs a block partitioning and parallel processing design and thus scales to large tensors, (2) Accuracy: we show that our method can achieve results faster without sacrificing the quality of the tensor decomposition, and (3) FlexibleConstraints: we show our approach can encompass various kinds of constraints including l2 norm, l1 norm, and logistic regularization. We demonstrate SGranite's capabilities in two real-world use cases. In the first, we use Google searches for flu-like symptoms to characterize and predict influenza patterns. In the second, we use SGranite to extract clinically interesting sets (i.e., phenotypes) of patients from electronic health records. Through these case studies, we show SGranite has the potential to be used to rapidly characterize, predict, and manage a large multimodal datasets, thereby promising a novel, data-driven solution that can benefit very large segments of the population.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31198910	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31198910	flu	-7492067511846042603

This mechanism is activated by endurance training and controlled by the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α1, which induces transcription of several kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) genes in muscle. KAT enzymes catabolize the neuroinflammatory tryptophan metabolite kynurenine, which can accumulate in the brain and lead to alterations associated with stress-induced depression (among other psychiatric diseases). Here, we discuss our findings in the context of what is known about the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation and how its many metabolites can directly affect the brain. These findings provide a mechanism for how physical exercise can improve mental health and offers potential therapeutic targets for future antidepressant medications.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314466	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314466	stress	3041906492387035176

Since the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of hybrid halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) could exceed 24%, extensive research has been focused on improving their long-term stability for commercialization in the near future. In a previous study, we reported that the addition of a certain amount of ionized iodide (triiodide: I3-) ions during the perovskite film formation significantly improved the efficiency of PSCs by reducing deep-level defects in the perovskite layer. Understanding the relationship between the concentration of these defects and the long-term chemical aging of PSCs is important not only for obtaining fundamental insight into the perovskite materials, but also for studying the long-term chemical stability of PSCs. Herein we aim to identify the origin of the natural decay in PCE during long-term chemical aging in the dark of PSCs based on formamidinium lead triiodide, by comparing the performance of control and low-defect (LD) devices. After aging for 200 days, the change in PCE of the LD devices (1.3%) was found to be half that of the control devices (2.6%). We investigated this difference using grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering, deep-level transient spectroscopy, scanning photoemission microscopy, and X-ray photo emission spectroscopy. The addition of I3- was found to reduce the amounts of hydroxide and Ox in the halide perovskites (HPs), affecting the migration of defects and the structural transformation of the HPs.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31306574	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306574	aging	-8149429101569453081

989	989	280	Aging cell	Changes in presynaptic calcium signalling accompany age-related deficits in hippocampal LTP and cognitive impairment.	The loss of cognitive function accompanying healthy aging is not associated with extensive or characteristic patterns of cell death, suggesting it is caused by more subtle changes in synaptic properties. In the hippocampal CA1 region, long-term potentiation requires stronger stimulation for induction in aged rats and mice and long-term depression becomes more prevalent. An age-dependent impairment of postsynaptic calcium homeostasis may underpin these effects. We have examined changes in presynaptic calcium signalling in aged mice using a transgenic mouse line (SyG37) that expresses a genetically encoded calcium sensor in presynaptic terminals. SyG37 mice showed an age-dependent decline in cognitive abilities in behavioural tasks that require hippocampal processing including the Barnes maze, T-maze and object location but not recognition tests. The incidence of LTP was significantly impaired in animals over 18 months of age. These effects of aging were accompanied by a persistent increase in resting presynaptic calcium, an increase in the presynaptic calcium signal following Schaffer collateral fibre stimulation, an increase in postsynaptic fEPSP slope and a reduction in paired-pulse facilitation. These effects were not caused by synapse proliferation and were of presynaptic origin since they were evident in single presynaptic boutons. Aged synapses behaved like younger ones when the extracellular calcium concentration was reduced. Raising extracellular calcium had little effect on aged synapses but altered the properties of young synapses into those of their aged counterparts. These effects can be readily explained by an age-dependent change in the properties or numbers of presynaptic calcium channels.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31310431	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310431	depression	-3206777048078326150

Despite the successful development of many 'caged' DNAzymes for light-induced activation, DNAzymes that are intracellularly activable by chemical inputs of biological importance, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), are still scarce. ROS like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hypochlorite (HClO) are critical mediators of oxidative stress-related cell signaling and dysregulation including activation of immune system as well as progression of diseases and aging. Using DNAzymes to study ROS-related cellular process requires ROS-activable DNAzymes to avoid the signals from cellular background events.

We determined the utility of a previously developed whole blood transcriptomic correlate of risk (COR) signature for (1) predicting incident recurrent tuberculosis, (2) tuberculosis diagnosis and (3) its potential utility for tuberculosis treatment monitoring in HIV-infected individuals. We retrieved cryopreserved blood specimens from three previously completed clinical studies and measured the COR signature by quantitative microfluidic real-time-PCR. The signature differentiated recurrent tuberculosis progressors from non-progressors within 3 months of diagnosis with an area under the Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.58-0.85) amongst HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Twenty-five of 43 progressors (58%) were asymptomatic at microbiological diagnosis and thus had subclinical disease. The signature showed excellent diagnostic discrimination between HIV-uninfected tuberculosis cases and controls (AUC 0.97; 95%CI 0.94-1). Performance was lower in HIV-infected individuals (AUC 0.83; 95%CI 0.81-0.96) and signature scores were directly associated with HIV viral loads. Tuberculosis treatment response in HIV-infected individuals on ART with a new recurrent tuberculosis diagnosis was also assessed. Signature scores decreased significantly during treatment. However, pre-treatment scores could not differentiate between those who became sputum negative before and after 2 months. Direct application of the unmodified blood transcriptomic COR signature detected subclinical and active tuberculosis by blind validation in HIV-infected individuals. However, prognostic performance for recurrent tuberculosis, and performance as diagnostic and as treatment monitoring tool in HIV-infected persons was inferior to published results from HIV-negative cohorts. Our results suggest that performance of transcriptomic signatures comprising interferon stimulated genes are negatively affected in HIV-infected individuals, especially in those with incompletely suppressed viral loads.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31297103	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297103	tuberculosis	6045455576279706291

Our previous finding demonstrated that chronic corticosterone (CORT) may be involved in mediating the pathophysiology of premature aging in rats. Frequent jet lag increases the risk for many diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, and is associated with the aging processes. However, the effect of jet lag on CORT-induced depression and its association with aging phenotypes remain unclear. In this study, the rats were exposed to both CORT and jet lag treatment, and the differences were analyzed and compared to rats with single CORT treatment. Our results showed that jet lag treatment aggravated CORT-induced depression-like behavior evidenced by sucrose intake test, forced swimming test, and open field test. Additionally, this treatment aggravated the shortening of telomeres, which possibly resulted in decreased telomerase activity, and downregulated the expression of telomere-binding factor 2 (TRF2) and telomerase reverse transcriptase compared to that in CORT rats, as revealed by quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. The shortening of telomeres may have been caused by increased oxidative stress, which was associated with the inhibition of sirtuin 3. Exposure to jet lag also aggravated the degeneration of mitochondrial functions, as shown by the decreases in the mRNA expression of COX1, ND1, and Tfam. Our findings provide physiological evidence that jet lag exposure may worsen stress-induced depression and age-related abnormalities.	2019	eng	Journal Article	China	31314053	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314053	aging	8835339470389644264

Background and Purpose- The impact of transfer status on clinical outcomes in the DAWN (DWI or CTP Assessment With Clinical Mismatch in the Triage of Wake-Up and Late Presenting Strokes Undergoing Neurointervention With Trevo) population is unknown. We analyzed workflow and clinical outcome differences between direct versus transfer patients in the DAWN population. Methods- The following time metrics were analyzed for each group: (1) last known well to hospital arrival, (2) hospital arrival to eligibility imaging, (3) hospital arrival to arterial puncture, (4) qualifying imaging to arterial puncture, (5) last known well to arterial puncture, (6) last known well to reperfusion. The primary end point was the rate of functional independence (90-day modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score, 0-2). Using univariate unconditional logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios and 95% CIs for the association between clinically relevant time metrics, transfer status, and functional independence (mRS 0-2). Results- A total of 206 patients were enrolled. Among these, 121 (59%) patients were transferred, and 85 (41%) patients presented directly to a thrombectomy capable center. Median time last seen well to hospital arrival time was similar between the 2 groups (678 versus 696 minutes). The time from hospital arrival to groin puncture was significantly longer in direct patients compared with transferred patients 140 minutes (interquartile range, 105.5-177.5 minutes) and 88 minutes (interquartile range, 55-125 minutes), respectively ( P<0.001). Differences in treatment effect or differences in rates of mRS 0-2 in the thrombectomy treated patients were not statistically significant in direct versus transfer patients (odds ratios for mRS 0-2, thrombectomy versus control, were 5.62 in direct and 6.63 in transfer patients, respectively, Breslow-Day P=0.817). Conclusions- Although transfer patients had a faster door to puncture time, benefits of thrombectomy, and rates of mRS 0 to 2 in the treatment group were similar between direct and transferred patients in the DAWN population. These results may inform prehospital and primary stroke centers triage protocols in patients presenting in the late time window. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

1004	1004	448	Stroke	Radial Artery Catheterization for Neuroendovascular Procedures.	Background and Purpose- Radial artery catheterization is an alternate route of access that has started to gain more widespread use for neuroendovascular procedures, and there have been few studies that describe its safety and efficacy. We present our institution's experience in performing neuroendovascular interventions via a transradial approach, with excellent clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction measures. Methods- We conducted a retrospective analysis and identified 223 patients who underwent 233 consecutive neuroendovascular interventions via radial artery access at our institution. The incidence of perioperative and postprocedural complications was investigated. We identified a subset of 98 patients who have undergone both transradial and transfemoral cerebral angiograms and compared clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction measures between the 2 groups. Results- The overall incidence of complications was low across all procedures performed via transradial access. Peri-procedurally, only 2 patients had symptomatic radial artery spasm, and there were no instances of iatrogenic complications (vessel dissection, stroke, and hemorrhage). In 10 cases (4.3%), the intended procedure could not be completed via a transradial approach, and, thus, femoral artery access had to be pursued instead. Ten patients complained of minor postprocedural complications, although none required therapeutic intervention. The mean procedure time was shorter for diagnostic angiograms performed via transradial versus transfemoral access (18.8±15.8 versus 39.5±31.1 minutes; P=0.025). Patients overall reported shorter recovery times with transradial access, and the majority of patients (94%) would elect to have subsequent procedures performed via this route. Conclusions- Radial artery catheterization is a safe and durable alternative to perform a wide range of neuroendovascular procedures, with a low rate of complications. On the whole, patients prefer transradial compared with transfemoral access.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31311466	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311466	stroke	240943776326872028

To support people with Down syndrome (DS), it is essential to know and predict the number of live births of children with this condition. In this study, we estimated DS live birth rates on the basis of maternal age distribution and numbers of births in the general population, the maternal-age specific chance for a live birth of a child with DS, and the prenatal diagnosis/termination rate. The total number of live births in Japan decreased to less than 1 million in 2016 and the percentage of women aged 35 years old or over giving birth has increased by sixfold. Prenatal genetic testing in Japan has gradually become more widespread, and 20% of all cases of DS were diagnosed prenatally in 2016. Meanwhile, the annual projected number of DS live births has remained steady at around 2,200 (22 per 10,000 births). In 2016, it was estimated that 70% of all DS babies were born to women of advanced maternal age (AMA). Given that Japan is facing a decreasing birth rate and an aging population, adoption of the practice of prenatal genetic testing for AMA has balanced the number of DS births over the last 7 years from 2010.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313514	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313514	aging	4012770927504386801

Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) caused by Mycobacterium bovis is an important re-emerging disease affecting livestock, wildlife and humans. Epidemiological studies are crucial to identifying the source of bTB infection, and its transmission dynamics and host preference, and thus to the implementation of effective strategies to contain it. In this study, we typed M. bovis isolates from livestock, and investigated their genetic diversity and distribution. A total of 204 M. bovis isolates were collected from cattle (n = 164) and Sicilian black pigs (n = 40) reared in a limited area of the province of Messina, northeastern Sicily, an area that had previously been identified as having the highest incidence of bTB in livestock on the island. All M. bovis isolates were typed by both spoligotyping and 12-loci MIRU-VNTR analysis. Results from both methods were then combined in order to improve the discriminatory power of M. bovis typing. We identified 73 combined genetic profiles. Thirty-five point six percent of the profiles were common to at least two animals, whereas 64.4% of profiles occurred in only one animal. A number of genetic profiles were predominant in either cattle or black pigs. We identified common genetic patterns in M. bovis isolates originating not only from neighboring districts, but also from non-neighboring districts. Our findings suggest that bTB is widespread in our setting, and is caused by a large number of genetically diverse M. bovis strains. The ecology and farming practices characteristic of the area may explain the substantial M. bovis heterogeneity observed, and could represent obstacles to bTB eradication.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31306431	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306431	tuberculosis	-3285620956704836473

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is reported to be more prevalent particularly in patients with Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) because of the autonomic dysfunction, but prevalence of OH is not known in patients with Alzheimer Disease (AD). The aim of the present study was to determine whether OH can be used to distinguish DLB from AD. 38 patients with DLB, 88 patients with AD and 521 patients without dementia, underwent Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment. OH were evaluated for the 1st (OH1) and 3rd (OH3) minutes, taking the data in supine position as the basis, by Head-Up-Tilt Test. Prevalence of OH1 was 43.2% in AD, 44.7% in DLB and 17.9% in patients without dementia, and OH3 was 44.3% in AD, 47.4% in DLB and 17.9% in non-dementia group. The frequency of OH1 and OH3 was higher in the AD and DLB groups than in the patients without dementia (p < 0.001), but there was no significant difference between DLB and AD in terms of OH (p > 0.05). The percentage of asymptomatic patients with OH was 87.2% and 89.6% during 1st and 3rd minutes, respectively, and this percentage was similar in three groups (p > 0.05, for each). There was no significant difference between the two dementia groups in terms of comorbidities, drugs and laboratory values (p > 0.05). OH is more prevalent in patients with AD than controls and similar levels are observed in those with DLB. The prevalence of OH equally is greater with DLB or AD disease progression. Clinicians should be aware of OH and its related consequences in the management of the AD in older adults.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31173842	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31173842	Alzheimer	5827857898404399503

Introduction Trigger finger (TF) is a common cause of hand pain, swelling, and limited motion. It is common in women and in the thumb. Diabetes mellitus (DM) increases the risk of TF. Individuals with DM who develop TF are resistant to both medical and surgical interventions. The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes of percutaneous trigger release in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Methods Fifty diabetic and 50 non-diabetic patients with a clinical diagnosis of TF were included after informed consent. Percutaneous trigger release was performed in all of them. Follow-ups for pain and/or neurovascular complications were taken after one week, one month, and six months. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS v. 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, US). Results In the diabetic group, 86% of patients had TF of grade III or above and in the non-diabetic group, 76% of patients had TF of grade III or above. At the one-week follow-up, 79.2% diabetic patients still had mild to severe pain and 60.4% non-diabetic patients had mild to severe pain. By one month, 40% patients in the diabetic group still reported mild to moderate pain, however, all patients in the non-diabetic group reported no pain. By six months, nine (20%) diabetic patients reported mild pain. There was no incidence of infection or neurovascular damage at any follow-up in the non-diabetic group, and in the diabetic group, 4.2% of patients had an infection on the one-week follow-up. Conclusion Percutaneous trigger finger release is a safe, reliable, time-saving, and cost-effective procedure for the management of trigger finger in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31309010	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309010	diabetes	5446022903655412342

The role of oral anticoagulants (OAC) in atrial fibrillation (AF) is well established. However, none of the randomized controlled trials included patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) leaving a lack of evidence in this large, challenging and unique patient group. Patients on hemodialysis (HD) with AF have additional risk factors for stroke due to vascular comorbidities, HD treatment, age, and diabetes. Conversely, they are also at increased risk of major bleeding due to uremic platelet impairment. Anticoagulants increase bleeding risk in patients with ESRD and HD up to 10-fold compared with non chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients on warfarin. There are conflicting data and recommendations regarding use of OACs in ESRD which will be reviewed in this article.

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of ilaprazole and esomeprazole both in initial treatment regimen and retreatment regimen of H. pylori infection in chronic gastritis and to explore risk factors for eradication failure. A total of 330 patients with chronic gastritis who were confirmed of H. pylori infection were enrolled in this study. 290 of them were initially treated patients and the 40 remained were patients with retreatment. Eradication assessment was performed at least four weeks after the completion of eradication therapy. Results showed that the eradication rates of the ilaprazole group and esomeprazole group were 91.4 % and 88.4 % for per-protocol (PP) analysis (p=0.41) and 89.0 % and 86.2 % for intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (p=0.48) in initially treated patients. Meanwhile, they were 75.0 % and 72.2 % for PP analysis (p=0.85) and 75.0 % and 70.0 % for ITT analysis (p=0.72) in patients with retreatment. The differences were not statistically significant. There was also no significant difference in safety between the two drugs. A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that demographic factors such as age, gender, alcohol, smoking, coronary heart disease (CHD), hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM) did not affect eradication rates. However, patients with higher DOB values and patients with atrophic gastritis had significantly lower eradication rates than patients with lower DOB values and with non-atrophic gastritis whether the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in eradication regimens was ilaprazole or esomeprazole. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the efficacy and safety of ilaprazole and esomeprazole were not significantly different both in initial treatment regimen and retreatment regimen of H. pylori infection in chronic gastritis and DOB values and type of chronic gastritis were to be independent risk factors for eradication failure. In addition, we discovered that a new quadruple regimen containing furazolidone and minocycline which achieved good efficacy and safety can be a promising option for retreatment of H. pylori infection.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31288901	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288901	heart+disease	5206308811707978799

"Since Barker's publication of ""The fetal and infant origins of adult disease"" in 1990, significant emphasis has been placed on the intrauterine environment and its effect on adult disease. Historical events such as the Dutch Famine and the 1918 Flu Pandemic have provided organic data about the epigenetic changes that can result from famine, infection, and stress. Mechanisms that allow for intrauterine survival may predispose to adult disease states when the fetus enters a world of abundance. As the field of in vitro fertilization (IVF) has developed and evolved, little attention has been paid to subtle yet significant differences in IVF offspring. Offspring of assisted reproductive technology (ART) have been reported to have higher rates of preterm birth, abnormal fetal size, and birth defects. It is clear that epigenetic modifications may begin as early as pre-pregnancy. These differences are likely not attributable to one factor in the IVF process. Each variable likely plays a subtle role in the epigenetic manipulation of the embryo. Thus, moving forward, physicians should practice with heightened determination to follow the long-term outcomes of the offspring of ART in an effort to further modify and perfect the field."	2019	eng	Review	United States	30866004	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30866004	flu	-6174871522512566947

Osteoblast number and activity decreases with aging, contributing to the age-associated decline of bone mass, but the mechanisms underlying changes in osteoblast activity are not well understood. Here, we show that the age-associated bone loss critically depends on impairment of the ability of megakaryocytes (MKs) to support osteoblast proliferation. Co-culture of osteoblast precursors with young MKs is known to increase osteoblast proliferation and bone formation. However, co-culture of osteoblast precursors with aged MKs resulted in significantly fewer osteoblasts compared to co-culture with young MKs, and this was associated with the downregulation of transforming growth factor beta. In addition, the ability of MKs to increase bone mass was attenuated during aging as transplantation of GATA1	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31299382	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299382	aging	-6634868367571835312

Erythropoietin (EPO) has been linked to cardioprotective effects. However, its effects during the aging process are little known. We investigated the effect of EPO administration on hemodynamic parameters, cardiac function, oxidative damage, and EPO receptor (EPOR) expression pattern in hypovolemic state. EPO was administered (1000 IU/kg/3 days) and then acute hemorrhage (20% blood loss) was induced in young and adult rats. There was no difference in plasmatic EPO in either age group. Hemodynamic basal condition was similar, without alterations in renal function and hematocrit, in both age groups. After bleeding, both EPO treated age groups had increased blood pressure at the end of the experimental protocol, being greater in adult animals. EPO attenuated the tachycardic effect. Ejection fraction and fractional shortening were higher in adult EPO treated rats subjected to hemorrhage. In the left ventricle, young and adult EPO treated rats subjected to bleeding showed an increased EPOR expression. A different EPOR expression pattern was observed in the adult right atrial tissue, compared to young animals. EPO treatment decreased oxidative damage to lipids in both age groups. EPO treatment prior to acute hemorrhage improves cardiovascular function during the aging process which is mediated by different EPOR pattern expression in heart tissue.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31306373	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306373	aging	2858969450431709251

Ixazomib, an oral proteasome inhibitor, has been demonstrated to significantly improve progression-free survival(PFS)in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma(RRMM). Ixazomib has recently been approved in Japan, but its effectiveness and safety have not been fully investigated in a clinical setting. We retrospectively analyzed the records of 28 patients with RRMM who were treated with ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone(IRd)in our institution between June 2017 and June 2018. The median patient age was 75 years at the start of IRd therapy. In total, 46.4% of the patients had previously received more than 3 treatment lines, prior to this study. The overall response rate was 37.0%, and the median PFS was 286 days. Over a median of 5 cycles of IRd, Grade 3 to 4 leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurred in 17.9%, 14.3%, and 32.1% of the patients, respectively; these incidences were higher than in previous reports. The severity of diarrhea or rash, however, was comparable with that in other studies. Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 50mL/min/1.73m2 received a lower cumulative dose of ixazomib and lenalidomide than those with other rates. PFS did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. Although it is necessary to carefully observe IRdtreated patients for hematological toxicity, IRd therapy is effective in heavily pretreated RRMM patients. It might be reasonable to reduce the dose of ixazomib in patients with renal impairment.	2019	jpn	Journal Article	Japan	31273172	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31273172	Diarrhea	1981046186743381313

Targeting the apoptotic pathway via BCL2 inhibitors has been considered a promising treatment strategy in the past decade. Initial efforts with small molecule BH3 mimetics such as ABT-737 and ABT-263 (navitoclax) pioneered the development of the first-in-class Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved oral BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax. Venetoclax was approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, and is now being studied in a number of hematologic malignancies. Several other inhibitors targeting different BCL2 family members are now in early stages of development.	2019	eng	Review	New Zealand	31313099	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313099	aging	4634963407423735625
1037	1037	130	Journal of neuroscience research	The effects of age and sex on the detection of pure tones by adult CBA/CaJ mice (Mus musculus).	Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a gradual decrease in hearing sensitivity. Previous electrophysiological and behavioral studies have demonstrated that the CBA/CaJ mouse strain is an appropriate model for the late-onset hearing loss found in humans. However, few studies have characterized hearing in these mice behaviorally using longitudinal methodologies. The goal of this research was to utilize a longitudinal design and operant conditioning procedures with positive reinforcement to construct audiograms and temporal integration functions in aging CBA/CaJ mice. In the first experiment, thresholds were collected for 8, 16, 24, 42, and 64 kHz pure tones in 30 male and 35 female CBA/CaJ mice. Similar to humans, mice had higher thresholds for high frequency tones than for low frequency pure tones across the lifespan. Female mice had better hearing acuity than males after 645 days of age. In the second experiment, temporal integration functions were constructed for 18 male and 18 female mice for 16 and 64 kHz tones varying in duration. Mice showed an increase in thresholds for tones shorter than 200 ms, reaching peak performance at shorter durations than other rodent species. Overall, CBA/CaJ mice experience ARHL for pure tones of different frequencies and durations, making them a good model for studies on hearing loss. These findings highlight the importance of using a wide range of stimuli and a longitudinal design when comparing presbycusis across different species.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31304616	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304616	aging	-1081723567492738167

1042	1042	277	Urology	Nocturia: A Highly Prevalent Disorder with Multifaceted Consequences.	"Nocturia is a bothersome, multifactorial condition with many underlying causes and contributing factors. Nocturnal polyuria (NP; overproduction of urine at night) is a frequent component. The prevalence of nocturia increases with age; specific estimates of prevalence are influenced by frequency thresholds used to define it. There is a tendency toward higher prevalence in young women than young men, which is reversed in later life. The association between frequency of nocturnal voiding and sleep disruption is well-documented. Nocturia correlates strongly with shorter sleep during the first part (2-4 hours) of the night, during which the first nocturnal void often occurs. A short time to first void after sleep onset (often referred to as ""first uninterrupted sleep period"") is associated with increased daytime dysfunction and decreased sleep quality and/or sleep efficiency. Adverse health consequences related to nocturia include poor sleep, depression, reduced quality of life, and increased risk of morbidity, mortality, falls, and fractures; studies have been able to establish a causal role for nocturia in only some of these. The potential impact of nocturia on health increases with age. By age 80, 80% of people will rise at least once per night to void. Despite its associated bother, nocturia is often accepted as a natural consequence of aging and many people do not seek help. Women, in particular, may be reluctant to report nocturia. This article reviews the prevalence of nocturia, possible impact on sleep, mortality and morbidity, and falls, and its importance in the elderly/frail population and women."	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31310770	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310770	depression	-5968239566051821631

Endocrinology and metabolism	Tracking adiponectin biodistribution via fluorescence molecular tomography indicates increased vascular permeability after streptozotocin-induced diabetes.	Adiponectin, highly abundant in plasma, plays an important role in mediating important beneficial effects in diabetes, inflammation and cardiovascular disease. To act on target tissues, adiponectin must move from circulation to the interstitial space, suggesting that vascular permeability plays an important role in regulating adiponectin action. To test this hypothesis, fluorescently-labelled adiponectin was used to monitor its biodistribution in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes (STZD). Adiponectin was indeed found to have increased sequestration in the highly fenestrated liver and other tissues within 90 min in STZD mice. In addition, increased myocardial adiponectin was detected and confirmed using Computed Tomography (CT) co-registration. A higher adiponectin content in the STZD heart tissues was further confirmed by ex vivo fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) imaging, immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. In vitro mechanistic studies using an endothelial monolayer on inserts and 3D microvascular networks on microfluidic chips further confirmed that adiponectin flux was increased by high glucose. High glucose levels did not change adiponectin receptor levels. An examination of the tight junction (TJ) complex revealed a decrease in the TJ protein claudin (CLDN)-7 in high glucose-treated endothelial cells and the functional significance of this change was underscored by increased endothelium permeability upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of 	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31310580	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310580	diabetes	-456161980484814803

1045	1045	101	Neurobiology of aging	Late aging-associated increases in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia are accompanied by heightened neuroinflammation in the hemi-parkinsonian rat.	Aging is a primary risk factor for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD), and aging differentially predicts the incidence of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). The goal of this work was to establish whether late aging-associated exacerbation of LID would be related to neuroinflammation in the hemi-parkinsonian rat. Two studies were conducted in which adult (3 months) and aged (18 months) male Fischer 344 rats bearing unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the medial forebrain bundle were injected acutely with vehicle or L-DOPA (6 mg/kg). LID was quantified, and neuroinflammation was assessed postmortem via gene expression markers in the striatum (experiment 1) or through concurrent large-molecule microdialysis (experiment 2). In addition to exacerbating LID despite similar levels of striatal dopamine loss, late aging was associated with persistently elevated IL-1β gene expression ipsilateral to lesion, as well as a trend toward greater extracellular concentrations of IL-1β in response to acute L-DOPA treatment. In contrast, aged sham-operated rats displayed greater extracellular IL-6. Taken together, these data demonstrate an age-related vulnerability to LID and highlight potential neuroinflammatory mediators associated with these effects.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31306813	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306813	aging	-7349721727282676870

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that is challenging to dissect into subgroups because of the heterogeneity present across the spectrum of the disease. Efforts to subclassify asthma using advanced computational methods have identified a number of different phenotypes that suggest that multiple pathobiologically driven clusters of disease exist. The main phenotypes that have been identified include (1) early-onset allergic asthma, (2) early-onset allergic moderate-to-severe remodeled asthma, (3) late-onset nonallergic eosinophilic asthma, and (4) late-onset nonallergic noneosinophilic asthma. Subgroups of these phenotypes also exist but have not been as consistently identified. Advances in our understanding of the diverse immunologic perturbations that drive airway inflammation are consistent with clinical traits associated with these phenotypes and their response to biologic therapies. This has improved the clinician's approach to characterizing asthmatic patients in the clinic. Being able to define asthma endotypes using clinical characteristics and biomarkers will move physicians toward even more personalized management of asthma and precision-based care in the future. Here we will review the most prominent phenotypes and immunologic advances that suggest these disease subtypes represent asthma endotypes.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31277742	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31277742	asthma	6807042796917367736
1047	1047	311	Food & function	Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) targets the platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor and inhibits human bronchial smooth muscle activation induced by PAF.	Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) is the main active ingredient of edible plant safflower. HSYA has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects. The inflammatory response is the key mechanism responsible for asthma, and the pro-inflammatory platelet-activating factor (PAF) is known to play a role in the pathology of bronchial asthma. In this study, we stimulated human bronchial smooth muscle cells (HBSMCs) with PAF and examined the effects of HSYA on the resulting asthma-related process. PAF stimulation induced HBSMC activation, induced proliferation, increased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α, and activated asthma-related signaling pathways. All these effects were significantly inhibited by treatment with HSYA (9, 27, 81 μmol L-1). The effects of HSYA were prevented by the addition of a PAF receptor (PAFR) antagonist or by PAFR gene silencing with small interfering RNA. These results suggest that HSYA may inhibit PAF-induced activation of HBSMCs by targeting the PAFR. Overall, these findings provide evidence that HSYA can be applied as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of bronchial asthma.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31292579	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292579	asthma	-5200964355640106406

Topiramate is a sulfa-containing drug which is able to disrupt the ocular blood barrier. Recently it has gained more popularity, being used in many clinical conditions. Nowadays, the cases of glaucoma induced by topiramate have increased due to the use of this drug to induce weight loss. We here described a 29-year-old female presented with a one-day history of blurred vision in both eyes and headache. She was using a weight loss formula containing topiramate 100 milligrams. Ophthalmologic exam revealed an important myopic shift of -7.00 spherical diopters at presentation with intraocular pressure (IOP) of 32 mmHg and a shallow anterior chamber in both eyes. After discontinuous of topiramate and use of cycloplegic eyedrops, myopic shift improved and IOP controlled after two days. The anterior chamber was significantly deeper in both eyes after two weeks. It is theorized that topiramate can provoke a ciliochoroidal effusion and, therefore, can cause an anterior displacement of lens-iris diaphragm with a secondary angular closure. The treatment must include cycloplegic and discontinuation of the drug. Sulfa-containing drugs lead to an indirect mechanism of angle closure, frequently bilateral and, as mentioned above, with a different treatment approach. If unrecognized and untreated, it can provoke high morbidity with possibility of bilateral permanent visual loss.	2019	eng	Case Reports	United States	31263722	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263722	headache	-4930542581518647030

In pace with the development of gene sequencing technology and transcriptome research, it has been found that 70 to 90% of the human genome is transcribed into RNAs, while only 2% of RNAs encode proteins. This implies that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) may exert vital biological functions and a full analysis of non-coding transcriptomes is needed. Over the past decade, the advance in high-throughput sequencing and transcriptome profiling has enabled the identification of circular RNAs (circRNAs) involved in many biological processes and the occurrence and development of diseases. Accumulating evidence has revealed that circRNAs may serve as new biomarkers for diagnosis as well as provide promising therapeutic approaches and novel drug screening strategies for leukemia. A comprehensive understanding of circRNAs in leukemia is a prerequisite for the development of clinical translational research. In this review, we will discuss the general information of circRNAs and focus on the current advances in understanding the association between dysregulated circRNAs and leukemia.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31306100	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306100	aging	-240359174314633445

Organophosphate flame retardants (PFRs) are used as additives in plastics and other applications such as curtains and carpets as a replacement for brominated flame retardants. As such, exposure to PFR mixtures is widespread, with children being more vulnerable than adults to associated health risks such as allergies and inflammation. Oxidative stress is thought to be able to modulate the development of childhood airway inflammation and atopic dermatitis. To evaluate these associations, the present study investigated the relationship between urinary PFR metabolites, their mixtures and urinary oxidative stress biomarkers in children as part of the Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health. The levels of the oxidative stress biomarkers, such as 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), hexanoyl-lysine (HEL), and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), and of 14 PFR metabolites were measured in morning spot urine samples of 7-year-old children (n = 400). Associations between PFR metabolites or PFR metabolite mixtures and oxidative stress biomarkers were examined by multiple regression analysis and weighted quantile sum regression analysis, respectively. We found that the non-chlorinated PFR metabolites, 2-ethylhexyl phenyl phosphate (EHPHP), bis(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (BBOEP), and diphenyl phosphate (DPHP) were associated with increased levels of oxidative stress biomarkers. Furthermore, the PFR metabolite mixture was associated with increased levels of HEL and HNE, but not 8-OHdG. The combination of elevated top 2 PFR metabolites was not associated with higher urinary oxidative stress marker levels. This is the first study to report associations between urinary PFR metabolites and oxidative stress biomarkers among children.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31310930	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310930	stress	8743240285401859304

The aim of our study was to compare long term outcomes of robotic and laparoscopic sphincter-saving total mesorectal excision (TME) in male patients with mid-low rectal cancer (RC) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT). The study was conducted as a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database, and we analyzed 14 robotic and 65 laparoscopic sphincter-saving TME (R-TME and L-TME, respectively) performed by one surgeon between 2005 and 2013. Patient characteristics, perioperative recovery, postoperative complications and pathology results were compared between the two groups. The patient characteristics did not differ significantly between the two groups. Median operating time was longer in the R-TME than in the L-TME group (182 min versus 140 min). Only two conversions occurred in the L-TME group. No difference was found between groups regarding perioperative recovery and postoperative complication rates. The median number of harvested lymph nodes was higher in the RTME than in the L-TME group (32 versus 23, p = 0.008). The median circumferential margin (CRM) was 10 mm in the R-TME group, 6.5 mm in the L-TME group (p = 0.047. The median distal resection margin (DRM) was 27.5 mm in the R-TME, 15 mm in the L-TME group (p = 0.014). Macroscopic grading of the specimen in the R-TME group was complete in all patients. In the L-TME group, grading was complete in 52 (80%) and incomplete in 13 (20%) cases (p = 0.109). Median follow-up 87 months (1-152). Whereas local recurrence was seen in eight cases (10.12%) and distant metastasis was seen in 18 cases (22.7%). Overall, 5 years survival was 83.3% in R-TME, 75% in L-TME groups.

Cell wall architecture of tension wood fibres represents a suitable biological system to study the mechanism of growth and maintenance of posture of trees growing under various physical and physiological growth constraints. In the present study, we investigated the spatial distributions of β-(1-4)-D-galactan, xyloglucan and xylans (both less and highly substituted) in the opposite and tension wood fibres of bent Leucaena leucocephala by immunolabelling with monoclonal antibodies LM5, CCRCM1, LM10 and LM11 specific to these carbohydrate epitopes. The presence of non-lignified, tertiary wall layer is the typical tension wood characteristic associated with the reaction xylem fibres in Leucaena. LM5 labelling of opposite fibres showed weak labelling in the cell walls indicating less concentration of β-(1-4)-D-galactans while tension wood showed strong labelling in the tertiary wall layer suggesting the gelatinous layer (G-layer) has a strong cross linking with β-(1-4)-D-galactans. Xyloglucan distribution was more in the compound middle lamellae and the primary wall-S1 layer boundary of tension wood fibres as compared to that of opposite wood. A weak labelling was also evident near the boundary between the G-layer and the secondary wall of tension wood fibres. The secondary wall of opposite and tension wood fibres showed a strong distribution of both ls ACG Xs (LM10) and hs ACG Xs (LM11) while a weak labelling was noticed in the compound middle lamella. Tension wood fibres also showed strong xylan labelling mainly confined to the lignified secondary walls while the G-layer showed weak xylan labelling. In conclusion, our results suggest that β-(1-4)-D-galactans and xyloglucans could be implicated in the tensile stress generation within the G-layer of tension wood fibres of Leucaena leucocephala.	2019	eng	Journal Article	France	31310944	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310944	stress	-21036008762564671

Some studies found that providing micronutrient powder (MNP) causes adverse health outcomes; modifying factors are unknown. We aimed to investigate if iron status and inherited hemoglobin disorders (IHbD) modify the impact of MNP on growth and diarrhea among young Lao children. In a double-blind controlled trial, 1704 children ages 6-23mo were randomized to: daily MNP (with 6mg iron plus 14 micronutrients) or placebo for ~36wks. IHbD, and baseline and final hemoglobin (Hb), iron status, and anthropometrics were assessed. Caregivers provided weekly morbidity reports. At enrollment 55.6% were anemic; only 39.3% had no sign of clinically significant IHbD. MNP had no overall impact on growth and longitudinal diarrhea prevalence. Baseline Hb modified the effect of MNP on LAZ (P for interaction=0.082). Among children who were initially non-anemic, final mean LAZ in the MNP group was slightly lower (-1.93 (95%CI: -1.88, -1.97)) vs. placebo (-1.88 (95%CI: -1.83, -1.92)), and the opposite occurred among initially anemic children (final mean LAZ -1.90 (95% CI: -1.86, -1.94) in MNP vs. -1.92 (95% CI: -1.88, -1.96) in placebo). IHbD modified the effect on diarrhea prevalence (P=0.095). Among children with IHbD, the MNP group had higher diarrhea prevalence (1.37 (95%CI: 1.17, 1.59) vs. 1.21 (95%CI: 1.04, 1.41)), while it was lower among children without IHbD who received MNP (1.15 (95%CI: 0.95, 1.39) vs. 1.37 (95%CI: 1.13, 1.64)). In conclusion, there was a small adverse effect of MNP on growth among non-anemic children and on diarrhea prevalence among children with IHbD.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31303184	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303184	Diarrhea	-8508598439431879680

Members of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family of proteins are central regulators of apoptosis, and resistance to apoptosis is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Targeting the apoptotic pathway via BCL2 inhibitors has been considered a promising treatment strategy in the past decade. Initial efforts with small molecule BH3 mimetics such as ABT-737 and ABT-263 (navitoclax) pioneered the development of the first-in-class Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved oral BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax. Venetoclax was approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, and is now being studied in a number of hematologic malignancies. Several other inhibitors targeting different BCL2 family members are now in early stages of development.	2019	eng	Review	New Zealand	31313099	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313099	cancer	-3170783292462058942

A database of 19 621 publications and 335 208 references from the Web of Science was investigated using the CiteSpace software. Some interesting findings were obtained. First, the most significant developments and progress in the medication-adherence research have occurred in North America and Europe. Second, Osterberg L. and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) are the most cited author and journal, respectively, with the strongest academic influence. Third, the existing studies on medication adherence primarily focus on pharmacology/pharmacy, psychiatry, public environmental occupational health, and general internal medicine. Fourth, research hotspots showed a diversifying trend and increasingly covered chronic diseases. Moreover, the topic of integrating formal outcome evaluations into adherence interventions is one long-term research hotspot. In addition, the research frontiers mainly focus on medication adherence for HIV/AIDS patients, especially active antiretroviral therapy. Finally, the evolution of the medication-adherence research has occurred in approximately three stages: The first stage involved the introduction of the term ""compliance"" into medicine, then the primary focus shifted to patient adherence to HIV/AIDS medication, and the final stage has involved a diversifying trend with more diseases and methods for measuring adherence being researched in the current stage. Furthermore, because of an aging population and a disease spectrum change in the current phase, the focus of medication-adherence research has gradually shifted from infectious diseases to chronic diseases."	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31297912	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297912	aging	5684817723169964056

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes acute respiratory infections. Rapid RSV diagnosis has an impact on patient management. In a newly developed molecular assay, named reverse transcription strand invasion based amplification (RT-SIBA) RSV assay, RSV RNA is reverse transcribed to cDNA and amplified and detected under isothermal reaction conditions. The performance of this assay was evaluated. Respiratory samples that tested positive (n = 81) or negative (n = 61) for RSV with the multiplex RT-PCR Anyplex II RV16 Detection Kit (Anyplex) were analyzed with the RT-SIBA assay. Discordant samples were tested with the GeneXpert Flu/RSV XC assay. Consistent results in at least 2 of the 3 methods were defined as reference standard. The RT-SIBA assay yielded a negative result for the 61 negative samples and a positive result in 71/81 (85.5%) of the Anyplex positive samples. After a resolution of discordant samples, the positive and negative percent agreement of the RT-SIBA assay were 92% and 100%, respectively. The RT-SIBA assay is a rapid molecular assay for the detection of RSV with good performance in clinical specimens.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31160164	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160164	flu	-3912939678517879962

1076	1076	604	 	Pediatric Type 2 Diabetes: Prevention and Treatment Through a Life Course Health Development Framework	Estimates project that one in three US adults may have diabetes in 2050. Until very recently, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was a disease diagnosed in adults, but as the childhood obesity epidemic has spread, the diagnosis of T2DM in adolescents has become more common. Early indicators suggest that the disease may be more severe and more difficult to manage when diagnosed in adolescents. It is projected that adolescents with T2DM will lose approximately 15 years of life. The economic burden of T2DM rises significantly as the years with disease increase. This grim forecast highlights that not only will the disease burden be significant but the economic burden will be high. The risk for developing T2DM begins in utero. Individual health development trajectories build from this starting point, the result of multiple factors that accumulate across time and are the result of biological conditioning during sensitive developmental periods. A major aim of this chapter is to demonstrate that a life course health development approach to pediatric T2DM is critical to a sound national strategy to prevent and treat pediatric T2DM. We review major factors known to influence the development of pediatric T2DM and track these across childhood. While these factors will likely change over the next decade, what will not change is the importance of placing these factors into context and recognizing that T2DM development is highly sensitive to the timing and social structures of multiple environmental exposures. Research recommendations are discussed through a life course lens.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314290	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314290	obesity	-1637159115260338032

An 11-year-old boy was referred to our clinic by his primary care physician for a headache evaluation. He had been complaining of severe, sharp, pulsating headache for 5 days. Attacks were restricted to the left side with a duration ranging from 2 to 20 minutes, 20-30 times a day. Attacks were associated with left autonomic symptoms (conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, eyelid edema, and ptosis). Two days after we prescribed indomethacin at 0.9 mg/kg/day, the patient was headache free. He stopped taking indomethacin 14 days after consultation because of drug eruptions. As of the time of writing, more than 1 year later, he has experienced no recurrence of headache. This case indicates the importance of improving awareness among general doctors regarding PH in children, and of conducting further investigations about low-dose, short-term indomethacin treatment.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31264201	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31264201	headache	-5622405819042018718

Following administration of tPA, there was continuous bloody discharge from the replant sites and the eyebrow, nose, and upper lip began to appear increasingly dusky. Our patient was determined to be a high-risk candidate for immediate revision surgery and he subsequently underwent a six-stage secondary reconstruction. At his most recent four-month follow-up, our patient is satisfied with his cosmetic and functional outcomes. This was a case of failed microvascular upper lip replantation and eyebrow and nasal replacement complicated by stroke and myocardial infarction. The authors review the common complications in replantation, particularly pertaining to upper lip reanastamosis, and discuss a potential novel complication encountered in this case relevant to both free graft and microvascular replantation.	2019	eng	Case Reports	United States	31312557	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312557	stroke	511891900317865118

The rate of regimen change was decreased for patients with formal education (HR: 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.97), under WHO clinical stage-III (HR: 0.57, 95% CI 0.45-0.73), and WHO clinical stage-IV (HR: 0.64, 95% CI 0.43-0.96). Patients who were taking CPT (HR: 2.05, 95% CI 1.45-2.89) had an increased rate of regimen change. Furthermore, the rate of regimen change was decreased for patients who were switched to second-line treatment due to virological failure (HR: 0.36, 95% CI 0.25-0.53), and due to drug toxicity (HR: 0.48, 95% CI 0.28-0.81).

Cellular damage produced by conditions generating oxidative stress have far-reaching implications in human disease that encompass, but are not restricted to aging, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, airway inflammation/asthma, cancer, and metabolic syndrome including visceral obesity, insulin resistance, fatty liver disease, and dyslipidemia. Although there are numerous sources and cellular targets of oxidative stress, this review will highlight literature that has investigated downstream consequences of oxidatively-induced DNA damage in both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. The presence of such damage can in turn, directly and indirectly modulate cellular transcriptional and repair responses to such stressors. As such, the persistence of base damage can serve as a key regulator in coordinated gene-response cascades. Conversely, repair of these DNA lesions serves as both a suppressor of mutagenesis and by inference carcinogenesis, and as a signal for the cessation of ongoing oxidative stress. A key enzyme in all these processes is 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), which, via non-catalytic binding to oxidatively-induced DNA damage in promoter regions, serves as a nucleation site around which changes in large-scale regulation of inflammation-associated gene expression can occur. Further, the catalytic function of OGG1 can alter the three-dimensional structure of specialized DNA sequences, leading to changes in transcriptional profiles. This review will concentrate on adverse deleterious health effects that are associated with both the diminution of OGG1 activity via population-specific polymorphic variants and the complete loss of OGG1 in murine models. This mouse model displays diet- and age-related induction of metabolic syndrome, highlighting a key role for OGG1 in protecting against these phenotypes. Conversely, recent investigations using murine models having enhanced global expression of a mitochondrial-targeted OGG1 demonstrate that they are highly resistant to diet-induced disease. These data suggest strategies through which therapeutic interventions could be designed for reducing or limiting adverse human health consequences to these ubiquitous stressors.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31311771	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311771	obesity	589254894302309232

In this study we aimed to determine whether decision-making ability, cognitive inflexibility and emotion-driven impulsiveness are associated with weight status as expressed by body mass index (BMI), percentage body fat, waist circumference and skinfold thickness in adults from eight different European countries taking part in the I.Family study. The Bechara Gambling Task was used to assess decision-making ability (n = 1717). The Berg Card Sorting Test was used to measure cognitive inflexibility (n = 1509). Lastly, the negative urgency subscale from the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale was used to measure emotion-driven impulsiveness (n = 4450). Hierarchical regression analyses showed that more emotion-driven impulsiveness was statistically significantly associated with a higher BMI, a higher percentage body fat, and a larger waist circumference in adults, controlling for age, sex, socioeconomic status, country and binge eating; but not with skinfold thickness. Cognitive inflexibility and decision-making ability were not statistically significantly associated with any of the weight status related variables. These results support that impulsivity in response to negative emotions, but not decision-making ability or cognitive inflexibility, is associated with the susceptibility to excessive weight (as indicated by a higher BMI, a higher percentage body fat, and a larger waist circumference). In people behaving impulsively when emotional, focusing on reducing negative affect or improving coping skills is of interest in interventions targeting obesity.

1103	1103	61	Medicine	Factors affecting the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding in acute ischemic stroke patients.	Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a common complication that occurs after stroke, and GIB may negatively affect patient prognosis. In this study, we aimed to examine:(1) the risk factors of GIB in acute cerebral infarction patients;(2) association between GIB and 1-year mortality in patients with acute cerebral infarction.Patients with acute cerebral infarction were divided into 2 groups based on the occurrence of GIB during acute stroke stage. Patient characteristics, clinical presentation, stroke risk factors, comorbidities, laboratory data, medication, and outcomes were investigated to analyze the associations between the variables and the probability of having GIB. In addition, patients in the study were matched individually by age, gender. A 1:1 matched case-control method and conditional logistic regression models for single and multiple factors were used to assess the risk factors of GIB in acute cerebral infarction patients.Clinical data of patients with acute cerebral infarction were reviewed and analyzed during the years 2015 and 2016. Finally, 1662 patients with acute cerebral infarction were included in this study, of whom 139 (8.5%) patients had GIB at admission. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the independent risk factors for GIB in patients with acute cerebral infarction were advanced age (OR = 1.030, P = .009), low Glasgow Coma Scale (GSC) score (OR = 0.850, P = .014), infection (OR = 4.693, P < .001), high NIHSS score (OR = 1.114, P = .001), and posterior circulation infarction (OR = 4.981, P = .010). The case-control study ultimately included 136 case-control pairs. Stepwise conditional regression analyses revealed that the independent risk factors for GIB in patients with acute cerebral infarction were low Glasgow Coma Scale (GSC) score (RR = 0.645, P = .011), infection (RR = 15.326, P = .001), and posterior circulation infarction (RR = 6.129, P = .045). The group with GIB had a higher rate of mortality and disability level (mRS grade ≥ 4) than the group without GIB (P < .001) within 1 year after stroke. In addition, independent risk factors of death within 1 year after stroke in patients were GIB (OR = 6.096, P < .001), infection (OR = 4.493, P < .001), mRS grade ≥ 4 (OR = 4.129, P < .001), and coronary heart disease (OR = 3.718, P = .001).GIB is a common complication after ischemic stroke. These identified factors may help clinicians identify risks of GIB before it develops. GIB is associated with increased risk of 1-year mortality and poor functional outcome in acute cerebral infarction patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31305417	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305417	heart+disease	-1429167743746492970

In this study, a simple, convenient and practical strategy was established for characterizing the saponins in this purified active fraction. The personal accurate mass database including chemical structure, molecular formula and theoretical mass was first constructed by collecting 110 reported known saponins from genus Albizia species. The raw data was obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry. The potential compounds were extracted from raw data, and matched with the accurate mass databases. A series of saponin compounds were predicted and their chemical structures were characterized by interpreting the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data. A total of 29 saponins including 10 new compounds and 5 first found saponins from A. julibrissin were successfully characterized in this purified active fraction using this new strategy.

1107	1107	568	PloS one	A novel model for predicting posthepatectomy liver failure in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.	Posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is the most leading cause of mortality following hepatectomy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Platelet count was reported to be a simple but useful indicator of liver cirrhosis and function of spleen. Spleen stiffness (SS) was used to evaluate the morphological change of spleen and was reported to be related to liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. However, the predictive value of platelet to spleen stiffness ratio (PSR) on PHLF remains unknown. A retrospective study was performed to analyze 158 patients with HCC following hepatectomy from August 2015 to February 2016. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the value of each risk factor for predicting PHLF. The predictive efficiency of the risk factors was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. PHLF occured in 23 (14.6%) patients. PSR (P<0.001, odds ratio (OR) = 0.622, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.493~0.784), hepatic inflow occlusion (HIO) (P = 0.003, OR = 1.044, 95% CI 1.015~1.075) and major hepatectomy (P = 0.019, OR = 5.967, 95% CI 1.346~26.443) were demonstrated to be the independent predictive factors for development of PHLF in a multivariate analysis. Results of the present study suggested PSR is a novel and non-invasive model for predicting PHLF in patients with HCC.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31269063	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31269063	Cirrhosis	6525794335263078309

Early-life wheezing-associated infections with human rhinovirus (HRV) are strongly associated with the inception of asthma. The immune system of immature mice and humans is skewed toward a type 2 cytokine response. Thus, HRV-infected 6-day-old mice but not adult mice develop augmented type 2 cytokine expression, eosinophilic inflammation, mucous metaplasia, and airway hyperresponsiveness. This asthma phenotype depends on interleukin (IL)-13-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells, the expansion of which in turn depends on release of the innate cytokines IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin from the airway epithelium. In humans, certain genetic variants may predispose to HRV-induced childhood asthma.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31284925	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284925	asthma	-5238066650780855302
1110	1110	605	 	Early in the Life Course: Time for Obesity Prevention	One of the reasons for the intractability of childhood obesity is the underappreciation of the complexity and interconnectedness of contributing factors across the life course. A multilevel approach for obesity prevention takes into account individual risk factors that operate “above water” (family, neighborhood, policies) and the interaction with biology and “underwater” influences (genetics, epigenetics, physiology) and recognizes that these factors also interact across the life course, starting before birth. We organize this chapter to reflect phases of life course health development, prenatally through adolescence, that appear to be most important for the development of obesity and present key examples to illustrate important risk factors, mechanisms, and gaps in research. One of the challenges to understanding influences on obesity risk is the extent to which associations described in observational studies are causal. We present alternative methodological approaches, including sibling-pair design, maternal versus paternal effects, Mendelian randomization, cohorts with different confounding structures, and randomized controlled trials, that can help disentangle causal associations. We conclude with recommendations for future work on methodology, research in emerging areas, and implications for practice and policy based on the current evidence.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314285	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314285	obesity	-7174595923544719736

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a vascular brain disease that causes very high rates of death and disability. Whether surgical or medical treatment is more appropriate is controversial.The purpose of the study was to examine the morbidity and mortality rates of surgical and medical therapy and their differences in order to determine which patients should be operated.In our study, the authors selected randomly and evaluated retrospectively 49 patients who were operated in Haydarpaşa Numune Research and Education Hospital Neurosurgery Clinic and 51 patients who received medical therapy at Neurology Clinic for spontaneous supratentorial ICH between January 2007 and December 2011.The authors documented a detailed history of each patient featuring their neurological examination, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Modified Rankin Disability Scale (MRDS), imaging, age, gender, and history of stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking and alcohol use, aspirin, or coumadin usage.As a result, the mortality rate found in our study was similar to previous studies (49%). Mortality of patients who underwent surgery (63%) found a higher rate of disability. This is because hematoma of the patients who were operated on larger volumes and diameters, GCS lower than and the higher MRDS scores, higher rates of herniation is connected. The authors concluded that very early operation does not create a difference in treatment between mortality rates. The authors observed that the most important factors for the prognosis of ICH patients whether operated or not are the GCS of patients at the time of arrival to the hospital and the nature of the hematoma.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31306386	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306386	smoking	5322532051893153382
1113	1113	70	Aging cell	New label-free automated survival assays reveal unexpected stress resistance patterns during C. elegans aging.	Caenorhabditis elegans is an excellent model for high-throughput experimental approaches but lacks an automated means to pinpoint time of death during survival assays over a short time frame, that is, easy to implement, highly scalable, robust, and versatile. Here, we describe an automated, label-free, high-throughput method using death-associated fluorescence to monitor nematode population survival (dubbed LFASS for label-free automated survival scoring), which we apply to severe stress and infection resistance assays. We demonstrate its use to define correlations between age, longevity, and severe stress resistance, and its applicability to parasitic nematodes. The use of LFASS to assess the effects of aging on susceptibility to severe stress revealed an unexpected increase in stress resistance with advancing age, which was largely autophagy-dependent. Correlation analysis further revealed that while severe thermal stress resistance positively correlates with lifespan, severe oxidative stress resistance does not. This supports the view that temperature-sensitive protein-handling processes more than redox homeostasis underpin aging in C. elegans. That the ages of peak resistance to infection, severe oxidative stress, heat shock, and milder stressors differ markedly suggests that stress resistance and health span do not show a simple correspondence in C. elegans.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31309734	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309734	aging	8872925201254666834

The neurocysticercosis (NCC) is also presumed to decrease. However, detailed information regarding the recent status of NCC in Korea is lacking. We retrospectively reviewed NCC cases from 1990 to 2016 at Asan Medical Center, a 2700-bed tertiary referral hospital in Korea. We identified patients based on clinical symptoms, brain imaging, pathology and serological assay. The cases were classified as parenchymal, extraparenchymal, and mixed NCC. Eighty-one patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was 54.5 years, and 79.0% were male. The number of NCC cases was highest from 1995 to 1999, and continuously decreased thereafter. Forty (49.4%) patients had parenchymal NCC, while 25 (30.9%) patients had extraparenchymal NCC, and 16 (19.8%) patients had mixed NCC. The seizure and headache were most common symptom of parenchymal NCC and extraparenchymal NCC respectively. Hydrocephalus was more common in extraparenchymal NCC, and patients with extraparenchymal NCC were more likely to require a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Cases of NCC are decreasing accordingly with human taeniasis and lesion location was the most important determinant of clinical presentation and outcome of NCC in Korea.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Korea (South)	31284349	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284349	headache	4161491675236615151

Inflammatory bowel diseases involve chronic intestinal inflammation which is mostly caused by Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC) conditions. Patients having UC are prone to colorectal cancer and dysplastic polyps, and also have sporadic adenomas. Syringic acid (SA) possesses many health benefits including antioxidant, anti-bacterial, and anti-cancer. This study was aimed to identify the effects of SA on UC, using a murine experimental model. Clinical symptoms and weight loss were significantly reduced in mice induced with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and treated with SA, compared to untreated mice. The effects of SA exhibited in DSS-induced mice were associated with significant decrease in the expressions levels of inflammatory mediators such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF-α], interleukin [IL-1β and IL-6]), remarkable amelioration of colonic architectural disruption, and a significant reduction in the activity of colonic myeloperoxidase. To further confirm the anti-inflammatory property of SA, RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides. SA dose-dependently inhibited the cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. It also decreased the expressions of p65-NF-κB and IκB, thus reducing the activation and nuclear accumulation of p-STAT-3	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313354	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313354	cancer	4001521928622781645

1122	1122	276	Neuropharmacology	Potential link between antidepressant-like effects of ketamine and promotion of adult neurogenesis in the ventral hippocampus of mice.	Recent studies have shown that ketamine, an open channel blocker of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), is effective for patients with treatment-resistant depression. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the potential link between antidepressant-like effects of a single ketamine administration and dorsoventral differentiation in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that elevation in the densities of neuronal progenitors and newborn granule cells by ketamine was seen in the ventral (related to emotion), but not dorsal (related to spatial memory), hippocampus in adult mice, although the densities of neural stem cells were not affected by ketamine in both the dorsal and ventral regions. Promotion of maturation of newborn granule cells by ketamine was evident in the ventral, but not dorsal, hippocampus. Behavioral analyses showed that ketamine did not affect spatial memory but ameliorated depression-related behavior. Western blot analyses showed that the basal expression of the GluN2B, but not GluN1, subunit of the NMDAR was higher in the ventral hippocampus than in the dorsal hippocampus. The induction of expression of GluN2B subunit of the NMDAR, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), GluA1 subunit of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR), and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), by ketamine was greater in the ventral hippocampus than in the dorsal hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that a single ketamine administration promotes adult neurogenesis in the ventral hippocampus quite selectively. Furthermore, ventral-dominant induction of the GluN2B subunit of NMDAR, p-mTOR, GluA1 subunit of AMPAR, and BDNF, in the hippocampus may underlie the unique antidepressant-like effects of ketamine.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31310776	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310776	depression	-8449536481786923901

Aflatoxins are harmful compounds that induced carcinogenic impacts on tissues. It could generate oxidative stress causing cells damage. Bioactive substances from natural plants could avoid mycotoxins' bad impacts. Cape-goldenberry (CGB), a source of active substances, was vacuum-dried at 30 °C then milled. Fresh and dried CGB-powder properties were estimated. Animal experiment was designed using six rat-groups to evaluate CBG effect to reduce harmful effect of aflatoxins. Rats treated groups were orally administrated by aflatoxins (AFs) with or without CGB in diets. Blood parameters, liver and kidney functions, serum lipids, and liver histological changes were estimated. The CGB powder showed several time doubles of phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidants than fresh fruits. Diet supplementation by CGB of AFs-treated rats showed enhancement in final weight, food efficiency, and weight gain compared to AFs treatment only. Also, liver and kidney functions, liver enzymes, iron level, tumors indicator, and serum lipids of AFs- rats. Moreover, total protein, albumin, and globulin reduction by AFs have been improved by CGB presence in diets. Histopathological studies for AFs-rats liver showed dilated blood sinusoids with aggregation of inflammatory, Kupffer cell hyperplasia, degenerated hepatocytes, and apoptotic cells. However, in AFs-rat groups fed CGB in diets, liver hepatocytes appeared to be almost normal similar to the control.

1129	1129	646	Developmental neurobiology	Down syndrome, Alzheimer disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy: the complex triangle of brain amyloidosis.	Down syndrome (DS) is the main genetic cause of intellectual disability worldwide. The overexpression of the Amyloid Precursor Protein, present in chromosome 21, leads to β-amyloid deposition that results in Alzheimer disease (AD) and, in most cases, also to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) neuropathology. People with DS invariably develop the neuropathological hallmarks of AD at the age of 40, and they are at an ultra high risk for suffering AD-related cognitive impairment thereafter. In the general population, cerebrovascular disease is a significant contributor to AD- related cognitive impairment, while in DS remains understudied. This review describes the current knowledge on cerebrovascular disease in DS and reviews the potential biomarkers that could be useful in the future studies, focusing on CAA. We also discuss available evidence on sporadic AD or other genetically determined forms of AD. We highlight the urgent need of large biomarker-characterized cohorts, including neuropathological correlations, to study the exact contribution of CAA and related vascular factors that play a role in cognition and occur with aging, their characterization and interrelationships. DS represents a unique context in which to perform these studies as this population is relatively protected from some conventional vascular risk factors and they develop significant CAA, DS represents a particular atheroma-free model to study AD-related vascular pathologies. Only deepening on these underlying mechanisms, new preventive and therapeutic strategies could be designed to improve the quality of life of this population and their caregivers and lead to new avenues of treatment also in the general AD population.

"Several problems such as myalgia, arthralgia, fever, dyspnea, generalized edema, and pleural effusion can occur in cancer patients following the chemotherapy, especially at the first cycle of the first chemotherapy treatment. Although it is assumed that some cytokines are associated with the development of these symptoms and signs, their pathophysiology has not been discovered completely yet. They are usually mild, but they may rarely progress to the severe stage of ""Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome"" with a high mortality rate. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between the serum levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-11 (IL-11), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and these symptoms and signs. A total of 44 cancer patients who had neither heart, lung, liver, renal, or thyroid disease were recruited into this study. Their symptoms and signs were examined and questioned before the first cycle of the first chemotherapy treatment and the 24 h after this chemotherapy. All participant's serum samples were taken, and the VEGF, TNF, IL-2, and IL-11 levels were studied. There was no association between the chemotherapeutic drugs, and the symptoms and signs such as edema, dyspnea, coughing, and flu-like symptoms.

However, personal contact with older adults and intergenerational exchange in the context of close families may mitigate such negative tendencies. So far, these effects have been studied in Western and industrialized contexts. The present study extended this work to the Cook Islands archipelago, a group of islands in the South Pacific characterized by low levels of industrialization and relative isolation from foreign influences. We tested the hypothesis that attitudes toward aging in the Cook Islands would be more positive than in the world at large, and that, within the archipelago, attitudes towards aging would be more positive in smaller, less industrialized communities with closer family ties. Participants (n = 70), were recruited from three islands varying in community size and strength of the family ties among inhabitants. They rated their aging attitudes on four dimensions. Contrary to our hypotheses, attitudes in the Cook Islands did not differ from those reported in industrialized nations and did not vary significantly across islands, even after controlling for personal contact to older adults. Potential limitations and implications for future research are discussed.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31314771	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314771	aging	2250978527027854837

Smoking and obesity are important factors related to the etiology and clinical features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The aim of this study was to carry out deeper analyses of the links between smoking status and body mass index as well as of the links between individual dimensions of health-related quality of life (QoL) and acceptance of life with disease in patients with COPD. Information about BMI, smoking status, clinical features of COPD, a COPD assessment test, and airflow obstruction indicators were obtained from 105 outpatients attending a pulmonary clinic. Analysis of covariance demonstrated that the subgroups of patients distinguished based on smoking status and BMI differed significantly in severity of Cough, Dyspnea, Limitation of daily activities, Lack of self-confidence, and Quality of sleep, independently of sociodemographic factors and clinical features of COPD. The results of our study suggest a certain path of the potential effects of obesity and smoking status on QoL.

The incidence of cancer-associated non-traumatic spinal cord dysfunction is rising due to population aging and better cancer treatment. The overall benefit of rehabilitation in specialized facilities for traumatic spinal cord dysfunction has been confirmed many times. Because of their fragility and multiple comorbidities cancer patients still face challenges to complete rehabilitation in the spinal rehabilitation facilities. In this narrative review we describe specific aspects, challenges in rehabilitation and opportunities to improve care. A literature search was performed in the PubMed database from 1 January 1978 to 30 November 2018. The focus was to find publications that discuss challenges and opportunities for rehabilitation of patients with non-traumatic spinal cord dysfunction due to a tumor. Most publications described the benefits of rehabilitation in specialized facilities. There were only few publications about survival and functional outcomes after rehabilitation for this patient population. Overall benefits including fewer complications associated with spinal cord dysfunction, less pain and depression, and better quality of life were shown. Within the past decades increasing number of publications revealed a growing interest for this group of patients. Despite major progress in cancer treatment, patients still have a limited vital prognosis and access to specialized rehabilitation units because of the concerns about the medical complexity. Patients with spinal cord tumors can benefit in areas of functionality, mood, quality of life, and survival from inpatient rehabilitation programs, in spite of the increased medical comorbidities.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Austria	31312916	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312916	aging	-8294676699502353515

This paper investigates how former hunter-gatherers living along the southern North Sea coast in NW Europe adapted to long-term and short-term climatic and environmental changes at the beginning of the Holocene. It is argued that contemporaneous hunter-gatherers repeatedly changed their hunting equipment in response to changing climate and environment, not just for functional reasons but mainly driven by socio-territorial considerations. Based on a Bayesian analysis of 122 critically selected radiocarbon dates a broad chronological correlation is demonstrated between rapid changes in the design and technology of stone projectiles and short but abrupt cooling events, occurring at 10.3, 9.3 and 8.2 ka cal BP. Combined with the rapid sea level rises and increased wildfires these climatic events probably impacted the lifeways of hunter-gatherers in such a way that they increasingly faced resource stress and competition, forcing them to invest in the symbolic defense of their social territories.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31314774	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314774	stress	5787934590133549357

Allergic asthma, is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the airway presenting with airway hyperresponsiveness and airway remodelling. T helper cells-derived cytokines are critically associated with asthma pathogenesis. Janus kinase-signal transduction and activation of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling is found to be involved in asthma. Magnolol is a plant-derived bioactive compound with several pharmacological effects. The study aimed to assess the effects of magnolol in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthmatic model. BALB/c mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA. Magnolol (12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg body weight) was administered to separate groups of animals. Dexamethasone was used as the positive control. Cellular infiltration into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were reduced on magnolol treatment. The levels of Th2 and Th17 cytokines were reduced with noticeably raised levels of interferon gamma. Lung function was improved effectively along with restoration of bronchial tissue architecture. OVA-specific immunoglobulin E levels in serum and BALF were decreased by magnolol. Magnolol reduced Th17 cell population and effectively modulated the JAK-STAT and Notch 1 signaling. The results suggest the promising use of magnolol in therapy for allergic asthma.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Korea (South)	31297009	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297009	asthma	-8529522981244750831

Residues 17 to 28 in human tau are not present in the mouse form of the molecule. Here we tested the capacity of these human tau residues to bind to specific proteins. Several proteins were observed to bind to these residues. Among those that showed the greatest binding were three related to energetic processes: enolase, glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase B. The latter did not bind to tau from brain extracts taken from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).

1171	1171	30	Gynecologic oncology reports	Cervical cancer in Tanzania: A systematic review of current challenges in six domains.	Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in Tanzania. After excluding human immunodeficiency virus, lower respiratory infections, malaria, diarrheal diseases, and tuberculosis, cervical cancer kills more women than any other form of illness in the country. Unfortunately, Tanzania has a low doctor-to-patient ratio (1:50,000) and nearly 7000 women die each year from this disease. The clinical problem is further magnified by the country's lack of resources and prevailing poverty, sporadic cervical cancer screening, prevalence of high-risk oncogenic human papillomavirus subtypes, and relatively high rates of human immunodeficiency virus co-infection. In recent years, addressing the cervical cancer problem has become a priority for the Tanzanian government. In this systematic review of 39 peer-reviewed publications that appeared in the PubMed/MEDLINE (NCBI) database from 2013 to 2018, we synthesize the growing body of literature to capture current trends in Tanzania's evolving cervical cancer landscape. Six domains were identified, including risk factors, primary prevention, barriers to screening, treatment, healthcare worker education, and sustainability. In addition to traditional risk factors associated with sexual behavior, acetowhite changes observed during visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid, lower education, rural setting, and HIV positivity also have a noteworthy clinical impact.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31309135	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309135	tuberculosis	7277161137091492767

The natural history of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) has been well described, particularly with respect to the parasite load in different tissues and immunopathological changes according to the progression of clinical forms. The biomarkers evaluated in these studies provide support for the improvement of the tools used in developing vaccines against CVL. Thus, we describe the major studies using the dog model that supplies the rationale for including different biomarkers (tissue parasitism, histopathology, hematological changes, leucocytes immunophenotyping, cytokines patterns, and in vitroco-culture systems using purified T-cells subsets and macrophages infected with L. infantum) for immunogenicity and protection evaluations in phases I and II applied to pre-clinical and clinical vaccine trials against CVL. The search for biomarkers related to resistance or susceptibility has revealed a mixed cytokine profile with a prominent proinflammatory immune response as relevant for Leishmania replication at low levels as observed in asymptomatic dogs (highlighted by high levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α and decreased levels in IL-4, TGF-β and IL-10).

We investigated the frequency of depressive disorders and determined the predictors of depressive disorders in Korean patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis. Sixty-one patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) were enrolled in this study. We assessed the Birmingham vasculitis activity score (BVAS), vasculitis damage index (VDI) and the Korean version of the short form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36). SF-36 consists of the mental component score (MCS) and physical component score (PCS). Depression disorder was identified based on the Korean version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (K-CESD-R) ≥ 16. Mood states including depression were assessed by the Korean edition of the Profile of Mood States (K-POMS) subscales. The mean age was 62.2 years (19 men). Twenty-eight AAV patients (45.9%) had depressive disorders based on K-CESD-R ≥ 16. Both SF-36 MCS and SF-36 PCS were negatively correlated with K-CESD-R (r = - 0.687 and r = - 0.594) and K-POMS depression (r = - 0.604 and r = - 0.480), respectively. The optimal cut-offs of SF-36 MCS and SF-36 PCS for depressive disorders based on K-CESD-R ≥ 16 were obtained as 48.07 and 55.63. Patients with SF-36 MCS ≤ 48.07 exhibited a significantly high RR for depressive disorders, compared with those without (RR 42.667). Also, patients with SF-36 PCS ≤ 55.63 showed a significantly high RR depressive disorder, compared with those without (RR 13.619).

This study was performed to evaluate the effects of vitamin D and n-3 fatty acids' co-supplementation on markers of cardiometabolic risk in diabetic patients with CHD. This randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted among sixty-one vitamin D-deficient diabetic patients with CHD. At baseline, the range of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in study participants was 6·3-19·9 ng/ml. Subjects were randomly assigned into two groups either taking 50 000 IU vitamin D supplements every 2 weeks plus 2× 1000 mg/d n-3 fatty acids from flaxseed oil (n 30) or placebo (n 31) for 6 months. Vitamin D and n-3 fatty acids' co-supplementation significantly reduced mean (P = 0·01) and maximum levels of left carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) (P = 0·004), and mean (P = 0·02) and maximum levels of right CIMT (P = 0·003) compared with the placebo. In addition, co-supplementation led to a significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose (β -0·40 mmol/l; 95 % CI -0·77, -0·03; P = 0·03), insulin (β -1·66 μIU/ml; 95 % CI -2·43, -0·89; P &lt; 0·001), insulin resistance (β -0·49; 95 % CI -0·72, -0·25; P &lt; 0·001) and LDL-cholesterol (β -0·21 mmol/l; 95 % CI -0·41, -0·01; P = 0·04), and a significant increase in insulin sensitivity (β +0·008; 95 % CI 0·004, 0·01; P = 0·001) and HDL-cholesterol (β +0·09 mmol/l; 95 % CI 0·01, 0·17; P = 0·02) compared with the placebo. Additionally, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (β -1·56 mg/l; 95 % CI -2·65, -0·48; P = 0·005) was reduced in the supplemented group compared with the placebo group.

A new series of coumarin-3-carboxamide-N-morpholine hybrids 5a-5l was designed and synthesized as cholinesterases inhibitors. The synthetic approach for title compounds was started from the reaction between 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde derivatives and Meldrum's acid to afford corresponding coumarin-3-carboxylic acids. Then, amidation of the latter compounds with 2-morpholinoethylamine or N-(3-aminopropyl)morpholine led to the formation of the compounds 5a-5l. The in vitro inhibition screen against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) revealed that most of the synthesized compounds had potent AChE inhibitory while their BuChE inhibitions are moderate to weak. Among them, propylmorpholine derivative 5g (N-[3-(morpholin-4-yl)propyl]-2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carboxamide) bearing an unsubstituted coumarin moiety and ethylmorpholine derivative 5d (6-bromo-N-[2-(morpholin-4-yl)ethyl]-2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carboxamide) bearing a 6-bromocoumarin moiety showed the most activity against AChE and BuChE, respectively. The inhibitory activity of compound 5g against AChE was 1.78 times more than that of rivastigmine and anti-BuChE activity of compound 5d is approximately same as rivastigmine. Kinetic and docking studies confirmed the dual binding site ability of compound 5g to inhibit AChE.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31155827	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155827	Alzheimer	-1254906787526072320

In adult, the relation between exposure, sensitization and symptoms has been demonstrated in severe asthmatics sensitized to Alternaria. For children, exposure to mould in childhood is a risk factor for asthma in both atopic and non-atopic individuals. Exposure or sensitization to moulds are a risk factor for severe asthma and/or exacerbations in children. There appears to be a causal relationship between exposure and asthma. This link seems less significant in adults. However, in adults mould sensitive asthma seems to determine a phenotype of severe asthma associated with more marked obstructive lung disease. Moulds can stimulate either innate or the acquired immunity. They are responsible for a marked Th2 inflammation leading to more severe asthma. Besides the immunological mechanisms, toxic mechanisms can also intervene. It is therefore not correct to reduce the effect of moulds, particularly in respiratory symptoms, to only allergic mechanisms.	2019	fre	Review	France	31303366	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303366	asthma	6783622248311192269

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an important cause of disease in young infants, stillbirths, pregnant and post-partum women. GBS vaccines for maternal immunization are in development aiming to reduce this burden. Standardisation of case definitions and ascertainment methodologies for GBS disease is needed to support future trials of maternal GBS vaccines. Considerations presented here may also serve to promote consistency in observational studies and surveillance, to better establish disease burden. The World Health Organization convened a working group to provide consensus guidance for case ascertainment and case definitions of GBS disease in stillbirths, infants, pregnant and post-partum women, with feedback sought from external stakeholders. In intervention studies, case capture and case ascertainment for GBS disease should be based on antenatal recruitment of women, with active follow-up, systematic clinical assessment, standardised sampling strategies and optimised laboratory methods. Confirmed cases of invasive GBS disease in stillbirths or infants should be included in a primary composite endpoint for vaccine efficacy studies, with GBS cultured from a usually sterile body site (may be post-mortem). For additional endpoints, or observational studies, confirmed cases of GBS sepsis in pregnant and post-partum women should be assessed. Culture independent diagnostic tests (CIDTs) may detect additional presumed cases, however, the use of these diagnostics needs further evaluation. Efficacy of vaccination against maternal and neonatal GBS colonisation, and maternal GBS urinary tract infection could be included as additional, separate, endpoints and/or in observational studies. Whilst the focus here is on specific GBS disease outcomes, intervention studies also present an opportunity to establish the contribution of GBS across adverse perinatal outcomes, including all-cause stillbirth, preterm birth and neonatal encephalopathy.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31303524	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303524	vaccine	5962268176939710955

1190	1190	116	Environmental toxicology	Phthalate plasticizer di(2-ethyl-hexyl) phthalate induces cyclooxygenase-2 expression in gastric adenocarcinoma cells.	The phthalate plasticizer, di(2-ethyl-hexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and its derived metabolites are common anthropogenic environmental toxins, which are known to act as endocrine disruptors. Numerous studies have associated DEHP with disruption of sex hormones, abnormal development of reproductive organs, allergies, and inflammation. Its role in promoting inflammation has been reported by both human epidemiological and animal studies. In stomach tissue, chronic inflammation is known to accompany mucosal damage, and pave the way to gastritis, stomach ulcers, and ultimately gastric cancer. Eastern Asian populations possess the highest gastric cancer incidences in the world. Coincidentally, East Asia is one of the world's major sites for plastics manufacture and export. Thus, possible correlations between DEHP, a common plasticizer, and gastric cancer are of great interest. Our study revealed several critical findings. First, even at very low dosage, mimicking the residual plasticizer exposure, detrimental effects of DEHP on gastric cells can be detected. Second, gastric cells treated with DEHP increased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in a time-dependent manner. Third, promoter deletion studies revealed a critical role of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) for COX-2 gene responses. Finally, our results indicated that a low concentration of DEHP is able to trigger COX-2 activation via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and NF-κB signaling pathway. Taken together, we demonstrate that very low doses of DEHP enhance the expression of the prototypical inflammatory gene, COX-2, in gastric cancer cells via ERK1/2 and NF-κB activation. This study provides important insights into the inflammatory process and damages associated with phthalate plasticizers exposure.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313480	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313480	cancer	4277778562135834208

The aim of this study was to assess the burden of atopic dermatitis (AD) in terms of disability adjusted life years (DALY), mental comorbidity, academic attainment, and ability to work. A population-based, cross-sectional questionnaire study was performed among 34,313 randomly selected adults from central Sweden in 2017. The prevalence of AD was 14% and DALY score 527 (uncertainty interval 305-826). Adults with mild AD had an increased relative risk ratio (RRR) of severe depression (adjusted RRR; aRRR 1.78, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.50-2.12) and anxiety (aRRR 1.97, 95% CI 1.69-2.30), which was higher for severe AD (aRRR 6.22 95% CI 4.60-8.42, aRRR 5.62 95% CI 4.10-7.71, respectively). Adjustments (aRRR) were made for sex, age group and highest level of education achieved. Persons with severe AD were less likely to have a university degree (aRRR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34-0.90) and a lower annual income (238,000-324,000 SEK: aRRR 0.51, 95% CI 0.39-0.77; 325,000 SEK or more 0.36; 0.25-0.58) compared with individuals without AD. For individuals with both AD and asthma, the relationship with both diagnosed depression (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.52, 95% CI 1.35-1.72; 3.51, 2.87-4.30) and anxiety (aOR 1.60, 95% CI 1.48-1.73; 2.31, 1.96-2.72) was stronger compared with those with AD only. These results suggest that AD implies an increased prevalence of comorbid mental conditions and an adverse impact on academic achievement and work. These adverse associations increase substantially for patients with severe AD and comorbid asthma.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Sweden	31289842	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31289842	asthma	3269302169678465882

Defects in the skin's barrier function are known to make it more likely for skin and soft tissue infection to occur in association with atopic dermatitis. These secondary infections sometimes develop into systemic infections such as bacteremia. Here, we report on our use of anti-IL-4/13 monoclonal antibody (dupilumab) on two cases with atopic dermatitis that was refractory to conventional management techniques and who had a history of serious infection (bacteremia and associated sternal osteomyelitis, infective endocarditis) caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Both cases had underlying congenital heart disease. The dermatological symptoms of both cases showed marked improvement at 16 weeks after the start of dupilumab use. The use of dupilumab on atopic dermatitis may lead to less risk of infection of skin and soft tissues deveroping serious infections due to an underlying congenital disease. When determining the treatment strategy, the cooperation of specialists in a variety of fields as well as the primary care physician was important.	2019	jpn	Journal Article	Japan	31308337	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308337	heart+disease	2765063319512128208

1195	1195	135	PloS one	Substituting polyunsaturated fat for saturated fat: A health impact assessment of a fat tax in seven European countries.	There is evidence that replacing saturated fat (SFA) with polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) lowers ischemic heart disease (IHD). In order to improve the population's diet, the World Health Organization has called for the taxation of foods that are high in SFA. We aimed to assess the potential health gains of a European fat tax by applying the SFA intake reduction that has been observed under the Danish fat tax to six other European countries. For each country, we created a fat tax scenario with a decreased SFA intake and a corresponding increase in PUFA. We compared this fat tax scenario to a reference scenario with no change in SFA intake, and to a guideline scenario with a population-wide SFA intake in line with dietary recommendations. We used DYNAMO-HIA to dynamically project the policy-attributable IHD cases of these three scenarios 10 years into the future. A fat tax would reduce prevalent IHD cases by a minimum of 500 and 300 among males and females in Denmark, respectively, up to a maximum of 5,600 and 4,000 among males and females in the UK. Thereby, the prevented IHD cases under a fat tax scenario would correspond to between 11.0% (in females in the Netherlands) and 29.5% (in females in Italy) of the prevented IHD cases under a guideline scenario, which represents the maximum preventable disease burden. Henceforth, our quantification of beneficial health impacts makes the case for the policy debate on fat taxes.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31291265	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291265	heart+disease	2546657529517570876

The Keap1-Nrf2 system plays a central role in the oxidative stress response; however, the identity of the reactive oxygen species sensor within Keap1 remains poorly understood. Here, we show that a Keap1 mutant lacking 11 cysteine residues retains the ability to target Nrf2 for degradation, but it is unable to respond to cysteine-reactive Nrf2 inducers. Of the 11 mutated cysteine residues, we find that 4 (Cys226/613/622/624) are important for sensing hydrogen peroxide. Our analyses of multiple mutant mice lines, complemented by MEFs expressing a series of Keap1 mutants, reveal that Keap1 uses the cysteine residues redundantly to set up an elaborate fail-safe mechanism in which specific combinations of these four cysteine residues can form a disulfide bond to sense hydrogen peroxide. This sensing mechanism is distinct from that used for electrophilic Nrf2 inducers, demonstrating that Keap1 is equipped with multiple cysteine-based sensors to detect various endogenous and exogenous stresses.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31315052	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315052	stress	-3723217532224917485

The majority of allergic diseases, including asthma, atopic dermatitis and food allergy, are caused by allergen-specific IgE production and Th2-polarized immune responses. Allergic sensitization is caused by DC activation of naïve T cells to generate and expand Th2-biased cellular immune responses, resulting in the production of cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Th2 cytokines induce the generation and expansion of allergen-specific IgE by B cells as well as accumulation of mast cells in tissues (Figure 1). Because of the central role Th2 immune responses play in the genesis of allergic disease, it is important to focus on therapeutic approaches capable of suppressing or redirecting these Th2 immune responses.

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the main risks of death, which is mainly caused by coronary arteries arteriosclerosis. The present study aims to investigate the potential roles of miR-17 in CHD. In the present study, Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). qRT-PCR and western blot were used to examine the mRNA and protein levels, respectively. CCK-8 and flow cytomtry were conducted to determine the proliferation and apoptosis of ox-LDL treated HUVECs. Moreover, luciferase assay was performed to confirm whether insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) was a target of miR-17. The results showed that miR-17 was upregulated in ox-LDL treated HUVECs, while IGF-1 was downregulated. The luciferase activity of ox-LDL treated HUVECs was decreased after the treatment of miR-17 mimics and IGF-1 3'UTR WT. Moreover, overexpressed miR-17 promoted the cell viability and inhibited the apoptosis of ox-LDL treated HUVECs, which was more potent after the treatment of IGF-1 siRNA. Furthermore, the expression of Bax and Caspase3 was decreased, and Bcl-2 was increased in ox-LDL treated HUVECs transfected with miR-17 mimics, which was further decreased after transfection with IGF-1 siRNA. Taken together, miR-17 may regulate the proliferation and apoptosis of ox-LDL treated HUVECs. miR-17 may be a promising biomarker for CHD.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31296440	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296440	heart+disease	-8706427875719844202

A traumatic childhood is among the most important risk factors for developing stress-related psychopathologies such as posttraumatic stress disorder or depression later in life. However, despite the proven role of astrocytes in regulating transmitter release and synaptic plasticity, the contribution of astrocytic transmitter metabolism to such stress-induced psychopathologies is currently not understood. In rodents, childhood adversity can be modeled by juvenile stress exposure, resulting in increased anxiety, and impaired coping with stress in adulthood. We describe that such juvenile stress in rats, regardless of additional stress in adulthood, leads to reduced synaptic efficacy in the ventral CA1 (vCA1) Schaffer collaterals, but increased long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission after high-frequency stimulation. We tested whether the glutamate-glutamine-cycle guides the lasting changes on plasticity observed after juvenile stress by blocking the astrocytic glutamate-degrading enzyme, glutamine synthetase (GS). Indeed, the pharmacological inhibition of GS by methionine sulfoximine in slices from naïve rats mimics the effect of juvenile stress on vCA1-LTP, while supplying glutamine is sufficient to normalize the LTP. Assessing steady-state mRNA levels in the vCA1 stratum radiatum reveals distinct shifts in the expression of GS, astrocytic glutamate, and glutamine transporters after stress in juvenility, adulthood, or combined juvenile/adult stress. While GS mRNA expression levels are lastingly reduced after juvenile stress, GS protein levels are maintained stable. Together our results suggest a critical role for astrocytes and the glutamate-glutamine cycle in mediating long-term effects of juvenile stress on plasticity in the vCA1, a region associated with anxiety and emotional memory processing.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313857	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313857	stress	-4798431998955209742

1207	1207	348	Preventive veterinary medicine	Cohort-level disease prediction by extrapolation of individual-level predictions in transition dairy cattle.	Dairy cattle experience metabolic stress during the transition from late gestation to early lactation resulting in higher risk for several economically important diseases (e.g. mastitis, metritis, and ketosis). Metabolic stress is described as a physiological state composed of 3 processes: nutrient metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Current strategies for monitoring transition cow nutrient metabolism include assessment of plasma non-esterified fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations around the time of calving. Although this method is effective at identifying cows with higher disease risk, there is often not enough time to implement intervention strategies to prevent health disorders from occurring around the time of calving. Previously, we published predictive models for early lactation diseases at the individual cow level at dry-off. However, it is unknown if predictive probabilities from individual-level models can be aggregated to the cohort level to predict cohort-level incidence. Therefore, our objective was to test different data aggregation methods using previously published models that represented the 3 components of metabolic stress (nutrient metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation). We included 277 cows from five Michigan dairy herds for this prospective cohort study. On each farm, two to four calving cohorts were formed, totaling 18 cohorts. We measured biomarker data at dry-off and followed the cows until 30 days post-parturition for cohort disease incidence, which was defined as the number of cows: 1) having one or more clinical transition disease outcome, and/or 2) having an adverse health event (abortion or death of calf or cow) within each cohort. We tested three different aggregation methods that we refer to as the p-central, p-dispersion, and p-count methods. For the p-central method, we calculated the averaged predicted probability within each cohort. For the p-dispersion method, we calculated the standard deviation of the predicted probabilities within a cohort. For the p-count method, we counted the number of cows above a specified threshold of predicted probability within each cohort. We built four sets of models: one for each aggregation method and one that included all three aggregation methods (p-combined method). We found that the p-dispersion method was the only method that produced viable predictive models. However, these models tended to overestimate incidence in cohorts with low observed counts and underestimate risk in cohorts with high observed counts.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31311636	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311636	stress	-57452526663870593

Optimal strength and stability of blood clots are keys to hemostasis and in prevention of hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. Clots are biocomposite materials composed of fibrin network enmeshing platelets and other blood cells. We have previously shown that the storage temperature of platelets significantly impacts clot structure and stiffness. The objective of this work is to delineate the relationship between morphological characteristics and mechanical response of clot networks. We examined scanning electron microscope images of clots prepared from fresh apheresis platelets, and from apheresis platelets stored for 5 days at room temperature or at 4 °C, suspended in pooled plasma. Principal component analysis of nine different morphometric parameters revealed that a single principal component (PC1) can distinguish the effect of platelet storage on clot ultrastructure. Finite element analysis of clot response to uniaxial strain was used to map the spatially heterogeneous distribution of strain energy density for each clot. At modest deformations (25% strain), a single principal component (PC2) was able to predict these heterogeneities as quantified by variability in strain energy density distribution and in linear elastic stiffness, respectively. We have identified structural parameters that are primary regulators of stress distribution, and the observations provide insights into the importance of spatial heterogeneity on hemostasis and thrombosis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31312933	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312933	stress	2731915238980099593

Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into functional insulin-producing cells (IPCs) holds great promise for cell therapy for diabetic patients. Despite recent advances in developing beta cell differentiation protocols, it is becoming clear that the hPSC-derived beta-like cells are functionally immature, and the efficiencies of differentiation can be variable depending on the hPSC lines used. Therefore, advanced methodologies are highly desirable for the development and refinement of beta cell differentiation protocols from hPSCs. In this report, we first derived and validated a Pdx1-mRFP/insulin-hrGFP dual-reporter cell line from MRC5-iPSCs.

Noise exposure or ototoxic drugs instigate various types of damage to the cochlea, resulting in hearing loss (HL). While the incidence of HL is growing continuously, there are, so far, no adequate drugs to prevent or treat HL. Avenanthramide (AVN), a natural product extracted from oats, has been reported to possess anti-oxidant/inflammatory properties, and protect several types of cells. In this study, we investigated whether AVN-C can protect auditory hair cells, and preserve hearing from noise trauma and ototoxic drugs. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were used to generate several HL models. Serum and perilymphatic fluid samples were analyzed using mass spectrophotometry to detect AVN-C. AVN-C crossed the blood-labyrinth barrier, and was detected in the perilymph after systemic injection. Pretreatment by AVN-C 24 h before exposure to temporary threshold shift noise contributed to the preserving hearing. Moreover, in the case of permanent threshold shift, AVN-C provided significant protection from noise. AVN-C also strongly protected against deterioration in hearing due to kanamycin and furosemide (K + F). According to the results of our scanning electron microscopy analysis, many outer hair cells (OHCs) were destroyed by noise trauma, while AVN-C prevented these losses. OHC loss due to K + F was even more severe, even affecting the apex. Strikingly, AVN-C treatment maintained OHCs at a level comparable to normal cochlea. AVN-C reduced the dichlorofluorescin (DCF)-positive population in gentamicin-treated HEI-OC1 in vitro. The expressions of TNF-a, BAK, IL-1b, and Bcl-2 were attenuated by AVN-C, revealing its antioxidant effects. The results of this study show that AVN-C crosses the blood-labyrinth barrier and provide a significant protection against noise- and drug-induced ototoxicity. Hence, AVN-C is a good candidate for future therapy aimed at protecting against sensorineural HL.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31312524	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312524	stress	3151804887212279872

1219	1219	374	Scientific reports	Immunological evidence for in vivo production of novel advanced glycation end-products from 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose, a glycogen metabolite.	The anhydrofructose pathway is an alternate pathway for glycogen degradation by α-1,4-glucan lyase. The sugar 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose (1,5-AF) acts as the central intermediate of this pathway, but its physiological role of in mammals is unclear. Glycation reactions forming advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are important in the development of complications of diabetes mellitus. We hypothesized that 1,5-AF may contribute to cellular damage by forming 1,5-AF-derived AGEs (AF-AGEs) with intracellular proteins. To clarify the role of 1,5-AF in protein modification, we created a novel antibody targeting AF-AGEs. Serum albumin modified by AF-AGEs was prepared by incubating rabbit serum albumin (RSA) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) with 1,5-AF. After immunizing rabbits with AF-AGEs-RSA, affinity chromatography of anti-AF-AGE antiserum was performed on a Sepharose 4B column coupled with AF-AGEs-BSA or N-(carboxymethyl)/N-(carboxyethyl)lysine-BSA. A novel immunopurified anti-AF-AGE antibody was obtained and was characterized using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Then an AF-AGEs assay was established using this immunopurified antibody. This assay was able to detect AF-AGEs in human and animal serum samples. Finally, intracellular accumulation of AF-AGEs was shown to be associated with damage to cultured hepatocytes (HepG2 cells). This is the first report about in vivo detection of AF-AGEs with a novel structural epitope.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31308400	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308400	diabetes	-4765711818183276269

To better understand the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of parvovirus, this study reports the isolation and characterization of a tiger parvovirus (TPV) named CHJL-Siberian Tiger-01/2017 from a captive Siberian tiger in Jilin Province, China. A phylogenetic tree based on the full-length VP2 nucleotide sequence was constructed using the isolated strain in this study and 56 reference strains. The results showed that all the parvoviruses can be grouped into two large branches: the canine parvovirus (CPV) branch and the feline parvovirus (FPV) branch. FPV strains comprised TPVs, FPVs, blue fox parvoviruses (BFPVs), mink enteritis viruses (MEVs), and raccoon feline parvoviruses (RFPVs), and CPV strains comprised CPVs and raccoon dog parvoviruses (RDPVs). RFPVs are also often very closely related to those sampled from other carnivorous species, and raccoons may represent conduits for parvovirus transmission to other hosts. The results of amino acid changes in the VP2 protein of the isolated strain showed that amino acid Ile 101 was mutated to Thr (I 101T). Taken together, a field TPV strain CHJL-Siberian Tiger-01/2017 was isolated, which may be suitable for future studies on FPV infection, replication and vaccine development.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a life-threatening condition that, unless treated at an early stage, can lead to congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and myocardial infarction. Early detection of diagnostic features underlying electrocardiography signals is crucial for the identification and treatment of CAD. In the present work, we proposed novel entropy called Renyi Distribution Entropy (RdisEn) for the analysis of short-term heart rate variability (HRV) signals and the detection of CAD. Our simulation experiment with synthetic, physiological, and pathological signals demonstrated that RdisEn could distinguish effectively among different subject groups. Compared to the values of sample entropy or approximation entropy, the RdisEn value was less affected by the parameter choice, and it remained stable even in short-term HRV.

Management of diabetic foot ulcers is a big challenge with poor and low sufficient outcome management. Therefore, achievement to effective treatments may treat these ulcers. Nowdays, platelet products are used as an effective and safe agent for promotion of healing proposes in regenerative medicine. Serum rich in growth factors (SRGF) is a source of released growth factors from the platelets. In the present study, effect of allogenous SRGF was investigated on the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic wounds in rats. STZ (50 mg/kh, SC) caused significant increase in blood glucose and weight loss in rats. Full thickness cutaneous wounds (8 mm diameter) were created bilaterally on the dorsal of the diabetic rats. SRGF was injected at the edges of the wounds of one side only on the first day, and the contrary sides were considered as the control group. The percentage of wound contraction was demonstrared on day 3, 7, 11 after surgery. Tissue specimens were collected for microscopic study on days 7 and 14. Results showed a significant higher rate of wound contraction on days 5 and 7 in the treated group.

Laboratory tests showed inflammation with a CRP level of 300 mg/l and a sedimentation rate of 60 mm in the first hour and ASLO levels were very high (1600 IU/ml). The diagnosis of infectious endocarditis due to valvular rheumatic heart disease was retained. After stabilization, antibiotic therapy and mitral valve surgery in emergency, the dermatological lesions regressed in a few days but the haemodynamic condition of the child deteriorated rapidly with sudden death. Besnier erythema is a rare cutaneous manifestation of acute articular rhumatism.

Castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains a major challenge for healthcare professionals. Immunotherapeutic approaches, including DNA vaccination, hold the potential to harness the host's own immune system to mount a cell-mediated, anti-tumour response, capable of clearing disseminated tumour deposits. These anti-cancer vaccines represent a promising strategy for patients with advanced disease, however, to date DNA vaccines have demonstrated limited efficacy in clinical trials, owing to the lack of a suitable DNA delivery system. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of a two-tier delivery system incorporating cationic RALA/pDNA nanoparticles (NPs) into a dissolvable microneedle (MN) patch for the purposes of DNA vaccination against prostate cancer. Application of NP-loaded MN patches successfully resulted in endogenous production of the encoded prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA). Furthermore, immunisation with RALA/pPSCA loaded MNs elicited a tumour-specific immune response against TRAMP C-1 tumours ex vivo. Finally, vaccination with RALA/pPSCA loaded MNs demonstrated anti-tumour activity in both prophylactic and therapeutic prostate cancer models in vivo. This is further evidence that this two-tier MN delivery system is a robust platform for prostate cancer DNA vaccination. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This article advances research regarding the development and utilisation of our unique microneedle (MN) DNA delivery system, which enables penetration through the stratum corneum and deposition within the highly immunogenic skin layers via a dissolvable MN matrix, and facilitates cellular uptake via complexation of pDNA cargo into nanoparticles (NPs) with the RALA delivery peptide. In the current study we report for the first time on using the NP-MN platform to immunise mice with encoded Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (mPSCA) for prostate cancer DNA vaccination. Application of the NP-MN system successfully resulted in local mPSCA expression within the treated ears of mice. Furthermore, immunisation of mice with the NP-MN system induced a tumour-specific cellular immune response, and inhibited the growth of TRAMP C-1 tumours in both prophylactic and therapeutic challenge models. These findings are significant as they represent the first use of the NP-MN system using the PSCA as a target for Prostate Cancer DNA Vaccination.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31299353	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299353	vaccine	8962537427807366481

This year marks the 100th anniversary of the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak on the Greek Aegean Sea island of Skyros, which devastated its population in less than 30 days. According to Constantinos Faltaits's annals published in 1919, the influenza attack on the island of Skyros commenced acutely 'like a thunderbolt' on the 27th of October, 1918 and was exceptionally severe and fatal. At that time, the viral cause of the influenza had not been detected, while the total number of victims of the Spanish flu outbreak has been estimated to have surpassed 50 million, worldwide. Almost one century after this Aegean Sea island's tragedy, the '4th Workshop on Paediatric Virology', organised on the 22nd of September, 2018 in Athens, Greece, was dedicated to the 100 years of the 'Spanish' flu pandemic. This review article highlights the plenary and key lectures presented at the workshop on the recent advances on the epidemiology, clinical management and prevention of influenza in childhood.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Greece	31186675	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31186675	flu	-3499919498720038879

Hog producers' operational decisions can be informed by an awareness of risks associated with emergent and endemic diseases. Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) have been re-occurring every year since the first onset in 2013 with substantial losses across the hog production supply chain. Interestingly, a decreasing trend in PEDv incidence is visible. We assert that changes in human behaviors may underlie this trend. Disease prevention using biosecurity practices is used to minimize risk of infection but its efficacy is conditional on human behavior and risk attitude. Standard epidemiological models bring important insights into disease dynamics but have limited predictive ability. Since research shows that human behavior plays a driving role in the disease spread process, the explicit inclusion of human behavior into models adds an important dimension to understanding disease spread. Here we analyze PEDv incidence emerging from an agent-based model (ABM) that uses both epidemiological dynamics and algorithms that incorporate heterogeneous human decisions. We investigate the effects of shifting fractions of hog producers between risk tolerant and risk averse positions. These shifts affect the dynamics describing willingness to increase biosecurity as a response to disease threats and, indirectly, change infection probabilities and the resultant intensity and impact of the disease outbreak. Our ABM generates empirically verifiable patterns of PEDv transmission. Scenario results show that relatively small shifts (10% of the producer agents) toward a risk averse position can lead to a significant decrease in total incidence. For significantly steeper decreases in disease incidence, the model's hog producer population needed at least 37.5% of risk averse. Our study provides insight into the link between risk attitude, decisions related to biosecurity, and consequent spread of disease within a livestock production system. We suggest that it is possible to create positive, lasting changes in animal health by nudging the population of livestock producers toward more risk averse behaviors. We make a case for integrating social and epidemiological aspects in disease spread models to test intervention strategies intended to improve biosecurity and animal health at the system scale.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31294037	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31294037	Diarrhea	5545306236636747547

Due to outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) and the wide use of attenuated live vaccine, both wild-type and vaccine strains (CV777) are believed to circulate in Chinese pig farms. Thus, identification of different PEDV strains is of epidemiological importance. In this study, a multiplex RT-PCR method was established based on the sequence features of spike (S) gene and ORF3 gene of PEDVs. The method could identify PEDV variant strains, classical wild-type strains and classical vaccine strains. The limit of detection of the RT-PCR was 1.51 × 104 copies/uL for plasmids and 1 × 101.7 TCID50/100 u L for PEDV, respectively. There were no cross-detections among three different PEDVs and no false detections among six swine pathogens. This assay was used to test 940 samples from China of which 303 samples were PEDV positive, and 289, 5, 10 were positive for variant, classical wild, classical vaccine, respectively. One sample was positive for both variant and classical vaccine PEDV. The variant PEDVs could be detected in samples from 13 provinces, while classical PEDVs were detected from nine provinces, supporting the prevalence of variant PEDV in China. In summary, this multiplex RT-PCR was a useful tool for the clinical detection and epidemiological survey of PEDV.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31288038	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288038	Diarrhea	-8864073373672512525

Accurate classification of breast tumors is vital for patient management decisions and enables more precise cancer treatment. Here, we present a quantitative proteotyping approach based on sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH) mass spectrometry and establish key proteins for breast tumor classification. The study is based on 96 tissue samples representing five conventional breast cancer subtypes. SWATH proteotype patterns largely recapitulate these subtypes; however, they also reveal varying heterogeneity within the conventional subtypes, with triple negative tumors being the most heterogeneous. Proteins that contribute most strongly to the proteotype-based classification include INPP4B, CDK1, and ERBB2 and are associated with estrogen receptor (ER) status, tumor grade status, and HER2 status. Although these three key proteins exhibit high levels of correlation with transcript levels (R > 0.67), general correlation did not exceed R = 0.29, indicating the value of protein-level measurements of disease-regulated genes. Overall, this study highlights how cancer tissue proteotyping can lead to more accurate patient stratification.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31315058	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315058	cancer	4306804750094230211

Chimeric antigen receptor-T cell (CAR-T) therapy has been effective in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, but it has shown limited efficacy against solid tumors. Here we demonstrate an approach to enhancing CAR-T function in solid tumors by directly vaccine-boosting donor cells through their chimeric receptor in vivo. We designed amphiphile CAR-T ligands (amph-ligands) that, upon injection, trafficked to lymph nodes and decorated the surfaces of antigen-presenting cells, thereby priming CAR-Ts in the native lymph node microenvironment. Amph-ligand boosting triggered massive CAR-T expansion, increased donor cell polyfunctionality, and enhanced antitumor efficacy in multiple immunocompetent mouse tumor models. We demonstrate two approaches to generalizing this strategy to any chimeric antigen receptor, enabling this simple non-human leukocyte antigen-restricted approach to enhanced CAR-T functionality to be applied to existing CAR-T designs.	2019	eng	Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural	United States	31296767	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296767	vaccine	310515487419366995

Cerebral diseases such as epileptic seizures, cerebral hemorrhages or meningoencephalitis are the primary cause of approximately 50 % of non-traumatic acute disorders of consciousness. For the differential diagnosis, history and other symptoms are important such as hemiplegia, signs of brain stem dysfunction, meningism or headache. Metabolic, endocrinologic, toxicologic or electrolytic causes of coma usually can be diagnosed by laboratory examinations. Anamnestic informations, body inspection, clinical neurological examination as well as laboratory and imaging findings have to be added and categorized by a multilevel composition to establish a conclusive diagnosis. Simultaneously therapeutic measures for suspected primary cerebral diseases must be initiated, for example a rapid antibiotic treatment in case of a possible bacterial meningitis. A fast and structured diagnostic approach is crucial for ensuring a good prognosis and helps to miss relevant diagnostic steps. Potential diagnostic and therapeutic pitfalls must be kept in mind.	2019	ger	Journal Article	Germany	31252440	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31252440	headache	-1492913151930215984
1264	1264	93	Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP	DFT study on the effect of proximal residues on the Mycobacterium tuberculosis catalase-peroxidase (katG) heme compound I intermediate and its bonding interaction with isoniazid.	Isoniazid (INH) is converted into isonicotinyl radical through its interaction with the catalase-peroxidase (katG) enzyme present in the cells of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb.), the bacteria that causes the tuberculosis disease. This process is important because resistance of M. tb. cells to INH treatment has been associated with the failure of completion of this process. However, this process is poorly understood and there are a variety of conflicting theories about the details of the mechanism of this process. One theory suggests that INH binds to katG and transfers a single electron to the heme while the heme is in its two electron oxidized state, compound I [Fe(iv)Por˙+] (CpdI). In this study, DFT calculations at the UB3LYP/6-31g(d)-LANL2DZ level of theory are used to study the M. tb. katG CpdI molecule. Different models of the M. tb. CpdI molecule were prepared and the calculations revealed the impact of Trp321 on the electronic properties of the heme. Without Trp321 the heme assumed a triradical state with single electrons on the πxy and πyz orbitals of Fe and another on the a2u orbital of the porphyrin ring that can either be coupled with the first two, to assume a quartet state, or decoupled to form a doublet state. With Trp321, however, a transfer of an electron from the πTrp orbital to a2u porphyrin orbital leads to loss of radical character of the porphyrin and leaves the Trp321 group with a radical character. INH was observed to have strong interaction with CpdI and the absence of Trp321 significantly decreased the binding energy by 2 kcal mol-1 explaining the importance of Trp321 in the binding of INH. The results in this study show the importance of Trp321 in the binding of INH and its effect on its electronic properties, which is consistent with previous experimental findings that mutation of Trp321 results in an increase in drug resistance.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31298238	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298238	tuberculosis	-7820640624231356730

1267	1267	123	Biologie aujourd'hui	[Brain network dysfunctions as substrates of primary headaches].	A large body of clinical and pre-clinical evidence has shown complex interactions between bottom-up and top-down mechanisms that are essential for the discrimination of noxious information and pain perception. These endogenous systems, mainly originating from the brainstem, hypothalamus and cerebral cortex, are strongly influenced by behavioral, cognitive and emotional factors that are relevant for the survival of the individual. Under pathological conditions, however, dysfunctional engagement of these descending pathways certainly contributes to the transformation from acute into chronic pain states. In disorders such as primary headaches, dysfunctions affecting brain regulation mechanisms contribute to the generation of episodic painful states in susceptible individuals, and to the evolution from acute to chronic migraine or cluster headache. Taken together, these studies support the concept that CNS mechanisms that process trigemino-vascular pain do not consist only of a bottom-up process, whereby a painful focus modifies the inputs to the next higher level. Indeed, several CNS regions mediate subtle forms of plasticity by adjusting neural maps downstream and, consequently, altering all the modulatory mechanisms as a result of sensory, autonomic, endocrine, cognitive and emotional influences. Disturbances in normal sensory processing within these loops could lead to maladaptive changes and impaired craniofacial functions at the origin of primary headaches.	2019	fre	Journal Article	France	31274102	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31274102	headache	-4726309075125105018

The insertion sequence 6110 (IS6110) is the most studied transposable element in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex species. The element plays a significant role in genome plasticity of this important human pathogen, but still many causes and consequences of its transposition have not been fully studied. Here, we analyzed insertion sites for 902 Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineage 2 strains using whole-genome sequencing data. In total, 17,972 insertions were found, corresponding to 827 independent positions in the genome of the reference strain H37Rv. To trace the history of IS6110 expansion since proto-Beijing strains up to modern sublineages, we looked at the distribution of IS6110 across the genome-wide SNP-based phylogenetic tree. This analysis demonstrated a stepwise transposition of IS6110 that occurs by «copy-and-paste» mechanism. Additionally, we detected evolutionary-scale and sublineage-specific integration sites, which can be used for typing and for understanding the reasons for the success of the lineage. A significant part of such insertions affected the genes that are essential for the pathogen. Finally, we identified and confirmed deletions that occurred between differently oriented elements, which is uncommon for this family of insertion elements and appears to be another mechanism of genome variability.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31302224	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302224	tuberculosis	-5507019982244746725

Tea polyphenols exert multiple beneficial effects on human health and may play a positive regulatory role in fat assumption. However, how tea polyphenols contribute to the regulation of fat metabolism remains unclear to date. Small RNA expression profile can be regulated by tea polyphenols in adipocytes. Therefore, tea polyphenols may regulate fat metabolism by controlling small RNA-associated biological processes. In this study, we developed a systematic research platform based on mouse models and performed small RNA sequencing to identify the specific role of small RNAs in the regulatory effect of tea polyphenols on fat metabolism. We compared the expression levels of different small RNA subtypes, including piRNAs and miRNAs, and identified a group of differentially expressed small RNAs in the experimental and control groups. Most of these small RNAs participate in lipid metabolism, suggesting that small RNAs play a significant role in tea polyphenol-associated obesity and related pathogenesis. Furthermore, gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment indicated that small RNAs influence the regulatory effects of tea polyphenols on obesity, revealing the potential pathogenic mechanisms for such nutritional disease.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31312655	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312655	obesity	5266164468981660031

The growing interest in the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) led investigators to identify modifiable risk and predictive factors useful to design early intervention strategies. The preclinical stage of AD is characterized by β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation into amyloid plaques and tau phosphorylation and aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles. There is a consensus on the importance of sleep within this context: the bidirectional relationship between sleep and AD pathology is supported by growing evidence that proved that the occurrence of sleep changes starting from the preclinical stage of AD, many years before the onset of cognitive decline. Hence, we review the most recent studies on sleep disturbances related to Aβ and the effects of sleep deprivation on Aβ accumulation in animal and human models. We also discuss evidence on the role of sleep in clearing the brain of toxic metabolic by-products, with original findings of the clearance activity of the glymphatic system stimulated by sleep. Furthermore, starting from new recent advances about the relationship between slow-wave sleep (SWS) and Aβ burden, we review the results of recent electroencephalographic (EEG) studies in order to clarify the possible role of SWS component disruption as a novel mechanistic pathway through which Aβ pathology may contribute to cognitive decline and, conversely, the eventual useful role of SWS in facilitating Aβ clearance. Finally, we discuss some promising innovative, effective, low-risk, non-invasive interventions, although empirical evidence on the efficacy of sleep interventions in improving the course of AD is at the very beginning.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31281257	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31281257	Alzheimer	-7399665664688732365

The cuniculture has become an important source of animal protein in many countries. The coccidiosis is the most common parasitic disease of the rabbits and is responsible for severe economic losses for breeders. Rabbit coccidiosis is caused by 11 species of the genus Eimeria, which vary considerably in terms of their morphology and pathogenicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate prevalence of Eimeria spp in backyard farms from Mexico during annual seasons. Cross-sectional sampling was performed in young rabbits (20 to 60 days of age) with diarrhea history, from three municipalities located in the south-east region from the State of Mexico. Flotation and Mc Master techniques were performed; oocysts were sporulated and measured for morphometric identification. The highest prevalence of Eimeria was found in autumn (75%) in Temamatla and winter (88%) in Amecameca, being the lower prevalence in spring (5%) in Temamatla. In terms of their pathogenicity  E. itestinalis was the more pathogen found in this study, being the annual prevalence of 11.3%. It is important to continue with studies of prevalence in other regions of the State of Mexico, in order to understand the pattern of presentation and distribution of the Eimeria spp infection.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Italy	31274182	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31274182	Diarrhea	-2855910583928922225

These drugs are frequently mentioned as ""legal highs"", ""herbal highs"", ""bath salts"" and ""research chemicals"". They are mostly sold and advertised on online forums and on the dark web. The emerging new psychoactive substances are designed to mimic the effects of psychoactive groups, which are often abused drugs. Novel synthetic opioids are a new trend in this context and represent an alarming threat to public health. Given the wide number of fatalities related to these compounds reported within the last few years, it is an important task to accurately identify these compounds in biologic matrices in order to administer an effective treatment and reverse the respiratory depression caused by opioid related substances. Clinicians dealing with fentanyl intoxication cases should consider that it could, in fact, be a fentanyl analogue. For this reason, it is a helpful recommendation to include synthetic opioids in the routine toxicological screening procedures, including analysis in alternative matrices, if available, to investigate poly-drug use and possible tolerance to opioids. To address this public health problem, better international collaboration, effective legislation, effective investigation, control of suspicious ""research chemicals"" online forums and continuous community alertness are required. This article aims to review diverse reported fatalities associated with new synthetic opioids describing them in terms of pharmacology, metabolism, posology, available forms, as well as their toxic effects, highlighting the sample procedures and analytical techniques available for their detection and quantification in biological matrices."	2019	eng	Review	England	31304442	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304442	depression	8163984238975480171

Silver nanoparticles (SN) have been recently developed as a new class of antimicrobial agents against numerous pathogenic microorganisms. SN have also been used as efficient drug delivery systems and have been linked with increasing drug potency. Here, we demonstrated the enhanced antifungal efficacy of nystatin (NYT) and fluconazole (FLU) after conjugation with SN. The antifungal bioactivity of NYT- and FLU-coated SN was evaluated against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Aspergillus brasiliensis ATCC 16404 by the agar tube dilution method. The aim of this study was to determine and compare the antifungal efficacy of NYT and FLU with their SN and, finally, the combination of both nanoparticles as NYT-SN + FLU-SN against pathogenic fungi. The results indicated that all test samples showed a dose-dependent response against tested fungi. SN significantly enhanced the antifungal effects of NYT and FLU as compared to drugs alone. We observed a remarkable increase in the percent inhibition of both fungi (90-100%) when treated with a combination of both nanoparticles NYT-SN + FLU-SN at 200 μg/mL only. Furthermore, the morphological modifications occurred at the surface of fungal species were also analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). While tested against primary human cell line, all SN showed negligible cytotoxicity. Hence, these results suggest that the combination of SN with NYT and FLU may have clinical implications in the treatment of fungal infections. However, in vivo studies are needed before recommending the use of these nanoparticles safely in clinical situations.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	30810990	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810990	flu	2265761247530716287

Betulinic acid (BA) and its derivatives possess potent pharmacological activity against cancer and HIV. As with many phytochemicals, access to BA is limited by the requirement for laborious extraction from plant biomass where it is found in low amounts. This might be alleviated by metabolically engineering production of BA into an industrially relevant microbe such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), which requires complete elucidation of the corresponding biosynthetic pathway. However, while cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) that can oxidize lupeol into BA have been previously identified from the CYP716A subfamily, these generally do not seem to be specific to such biosynthesis and, in any case, have not been shown to enable high-yielding metabolic engineering. Here RoCYP01 (CYP716A155) was identified from the BA-producing plant Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) and demonstrated to effectively convert lupeol into BA, with strong correlation of its expression and BA accumulation. This was further utilized to construct a yeast strain that yields > 1 g/L of BA, providing a viable route for biotechnological production of this valuable triterpenoid.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31309269	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309269	HIV	1440793148901830221
1309	1309	87	Scientific reports	Nicotinamide Augments the Anti-Inflammatory Properties of Resveratrol through PARP1 Activation.	Resveratrol (RSV) and nicotinamide (NAM) have garnered considerable attention due to their anti-inflammatory and anti-aging properties. NAM is a transient inhibitor of class III histone deacetylase SIRTs (silent mating type information regulation 2 homologs) and SIRT1 is an inhibitor of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP1). The debate on the relationship between RSV and SIRT1 has precluded the use of RSV as a therapeutic drug. Recent work demonstrated that RSV facilitates tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS)-dependent activation of PARP1. Moreover, treatment with NAM is sufficient to facilitate the nuclear localization of TyrRS that activates PARP1. RSV and NAM have emerged as potent agonists of PARP1 through inhibition of SIRT1. In this study, we evaluated the effects of RSV and NAM on pro-inflammatory macrophages. Our results demonstrate that treatment with either RSV or NAM attenuates the expression of pro-inflammatory markers. Strikingly, the combination of RSV with NAM, exerts additive effects on PARP1 activation. Consistently, treatment with PARP1 inhibitor antagonized the anti-inflammatory effect of both RSV and NAM. For the first time, we report the ability of NAM to augment PARP1 activation, induced by RSV, and its associated anti-inflammatory effects mediated through the induction of BCL6 with the concomitant down regulation of COX-2.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31308445	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308445	aging	-799315203186826480

Vaccine immunotherapy consisting of tumor antigens combined with an immune-enhancing adjuvant fosters cytotoxic T cell (CTL) proliferation. Clinically, polyI:C has been used as an adjuvant to enhance cancer vaccine protocols. However, according to its long history, polyI:C promotes inflammation that causes cytokine toxicity. Although checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy has improved the prognoses of patients with progressive cancer, over 75% of patients continue to experience resistance to antibody (Ab) against anti-programmed cell death-protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand, PD-L1 therapy. In most cases, patients suffer from adverse events resulting from inflammation during anti-PD-1/L1 Ab therapy, which is a serious obstacle to patients' quality of life. We have studied the functional properties of double-stranded (ds)RNA and polyI:C, and developed a nucleic acid adjuvant that barely induces a significant increase in the level of serum inflammatory cytokines in mouse models. This adjuvant, termed ARNAX, consists of DNA-capped dsRNA that specifies the endosomal target for Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in dendritic cells (DCs). We expect that this adjuvant is safe for administration in elderly patients with cancer receiving immunotherapy. Here, we summarize the properties of ARNAX for immunotherapy in mice. We suggest that DC-priming is essential to induce anti-tumor immunity; neither exogenous inflammation nor the administration of tumor antigens is always a prerequisite for DC-mediated CTL proliferation. If our mouse data can be extrapolated to humans, ARNAX and the liberated endogenous tumor antigens may facilitate effect of current therapies on patients with therapy-resistant tumors.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31302192	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302192	vaccine	-3027055440570405664

PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched from the earliest records to May 2018. Data involving the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes were extracted for meta-analysis. The results showed that the incidence of VAP was 36% (95% confidence interval (CI) 31-41%); risk factors analyses showed that smoking [odds ratio (OR) 2.13; 95% CI 1.16-3.92], tracheostomy (OR 9.55; 95% CI 3.24-28.17), blood transfusion on admission (OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.24-5.18), barbiturate infusion (OR 3.52; 95% CI 1.68-7.40), injury severity score (OR 4.65; 95% CI 1.96-7.34), and head abbreviated injury scale (OR 2.99; 95% CI 1.66-5.37) were related to the occurrence of VAP. When patients developed VAP, mechanical ventilation time (OR 5.45; 95% CI 3.78-7.12), ICU length of stay (OR 6.85; 95% CI 4.90-8.79), and hospital length of stay (OR 10.92; 95% CI 9.12-12.72) were significantly increased. However, VAP was not associated with an increased risk of mortality (OR 1.28; 95% CI 0.74-2.21). VAP is common in patients with TBI. It is affected by a series of factors and has a poor prognosis.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31300956	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300956	smoking	1862503310075246782

1322	1322	586	Scientific reports	Expression of neuropeptide Y is increased in an activated human HSC cell line.	Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an abundant neuropeptide in the mammalian central and peripheral nervous systems. Transgenic mice overexpressing NPY in noradrenergic neurons have increased level of hepatic triglycerides, fatty acids and cholesterol, which contributed to the development of hepatosteatosis. However, the roles of NPY in the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the expression and secretion of NPY in human immortalized HSC LX-2 cells and the regulatory function of NPY on the fibrogenic response in LX-2 cells, to explore the potential association between NPY and LX-2 activation. The results showed an increase in the expression and secretion of NPY(1-36) in activated LX-2 cells. Both endogenous and exogenous NPY(1-36) induced the phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K, and 4EBP1 and promoted the fibrogenic response via NPY Y1 receptor subtype (NPY1R), as these responses were blocked by either an NPY1R antagonist (BIBP3226) or NPY1R knockdown. Moreover, NPY(1-36) serum levels were increased in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and presented a positive relationship with MELD scores in LC patients. These findings suggest that immortalized HSCs LX-2 have the potential to produce NPY(1-36). High serum levels of NPY(1-36) is correlated with hepatic dysfunction in cirrhotic patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31263154	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263154	Cirrhosis	1061238072586805321

1324	1324	37	Nature reviews. Microbiology	Restriction of HIV-1 and other retroviruses by TRIM5.	Mammalian cells express a variety of innate immune proteins - known as restriction factors - which defend against invading retroviruses such as HIV-1. Two members of the tripartite motif protein family - TRIM5α and TRIMCyp - were identified in 2004 as restriction factors that recognize and inactivate the capsid shell that surrounds and protects the incoming retroviral core. Research on these TRIM5 proteins has uncovered a novel mode of non-self recognition that protects against cross-species transmission of retroviruses. Our developing understanding of the mechanism of TRIM5 restriction underscores the concept that core uncoating and reverse transcription of the viral genome are coordinated processes rather than discrete steps of the post-entry pathway of retrovirus replication. In this Review, we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of TRIM5-mediated restriction, highlight recent advances and discuss implications for the development of capsid-targeted antiviral therapeutics.	2019	eng	Review	England	31312031	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312031	HIV	-4228415104574264137

Antibiotic killing does not occur at a single, precise time for all cells within a population. Variability in time to death can be caused by stochastic expression of genes, resulting in differences in endogenous stress-resistance levels between individual cells in a population. Here we investigate whether single-cell differences in gene expression prior to antibiotic exposure are related to cell survival times after antibiotic exposure for a range of genes of diverse function. We quantified the time to death of single cells under antibiotic exposure in combination with expression of reporters. For some reporters, including genes involved in stress response and cellular processes like metabolism, the time to cell death had a strong relationship with the initial expression level of the genes. Our results highlight the single-cell level non-uniformity of antibiotic killing and also provide examples of key genes where cell-to-cell variation in expression is strongly linked to extended durations of antibiotic survival.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31312728	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312728	stress	-9222795471790223670

And within that state, the 38 counties comprising South Texas--a highly populated, largely Hispanic area characterized by high uninsured rates and low numbers of health care providers--are emblematic of nationwide crises in public health. The South Texas Health Status Review: A Health Disparities Roadmap brings health care disparities to light in instructive detail. Over thirty key health conditions and risk factors, such as breast cancer, diabetes, obesity, tuberculosis, smoking and alcohol use, lead exposure, birth defects, and homicide rates, are analyzed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and location (urban or rural), and the results compared with the rest of Texas and the nation as a whole. A section on conclusions and recommendations outlines factors contributing to these conditions and offers suggestions for improvement. These important data should stimulate further population studies and provide impetus for targeted public health interventions and community outreach programs to reduce health inequities and advance care access in the state and the U.S. at large. Major health issues covered in the report include: • Communicable diseases • Cancer incidence and mortality • Maternal and child health • Chronic diseases • Behavioral risk factors in adults • Environmental health issues • Suicide, homicide, and vehicular mortality. The South Texas Health Status Review contains valuable lessons for researchers in health promotion and health disparities, as well as community health professionals. Policymakers involved in reducing health disparities will find it especially useful.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314218	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314218	smoking	-2382583983070627054

1333	1333	59	Advances in immunology	Airway mycosis in allergic airway disease.	The allergic airway diseases, including chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), asthma, allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM) and many others, comprise a heterogeneous collection of inflammatory disorders affecting the upper and lower airways and lung parenchyma that represent the most common chronic diseases of humanity. In addition to their shared tissue tropism, the allergic airway diseases are characterized by a distinct pattern of inflammation involving the accumulation of eosinophils, type 2 macrophages, innate lymphoid cells type 2 (ILC2), IgE-secreting B cells, and T helper type 2 (Th2) cells in airway tissues, and the prominent production of type 2 cytokines including interleukin (IL-) 33, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and many others. These factors and related inflammatory molecules induce characteristic remodeling and other changes of the airways that include goblet cell metaplasia, enhanced mucus secretion, smooth muscle hypertrophy, tissue swelling and polyp formation that account for the major clinical manifestations of nasal obstruction, headache, hyposmia, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, wheezing, and, in the most severe cases of lower airway disease, death due to respiratory failure or disseminated, systemic disease. The syndromic nature of the allergic airway diseases that now include many physiological variants or endotypes suggests that distinct endogenous or environmental factors underlie their expression. However, findings from different perspectives now collectively link these disorders to a single infectious source, the fungi, and a molecular pathogenesis that involves the local production of airway proteinases by these organisms. In this review, we discuss the evidence linking fungi and their proteinases to the surprisingly wide variety of chronic airway and systemic disorders and the immune pathogenesis of these conditions as they relate to environmental fungi. We further discuss the important implications these new findings have for the diagnosis and future therapy of these common conditions.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31296304	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296304	headache	9136323715291453594

Streptococcus agalactiae is an important pathogen of tilapia causing enormous economic losses worldwide. In this study, multi-locus sequence typing indicated that 75 S. agalactiae isolates from tilapia in southern China were of the ST-7, as well as, belonging to serotype Ia confirmed by a multiplex PCR assay. The putative-virulence gene profiles and genetic variation of these strains were determined by three sets of multiplex PCR and multi-virulence locus sequencing typing (MVLST), respectively. Analysis of putative-virulence gene profiles showed that each strain harbored 18 putative-virulence genes but lacked lmb and scpB. Three putative-virulence genes (srr-1, bibA, and fbsA) were further selected for MVLST analysis. Our data showed that the strains had 14 MVLST types (1-14) and clustered in three groups (Groups I-Ⅲ). A period of time between 2013 and 2014 was an important turning point for the differentiation of the putative-virulence genes of S. agalactiae, as type 1 within Groups Ⅱ became the predominant MVLST type. There were significant differences in MVLST types of S. agalactiae isolated from different tilapia farming regions. MVLST assay may improve the discriminatory power and is suitable for understanding the epidemiology of S. agalactiae serotype Ia and screening multivalent vaccine candidate strains.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31299078	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299078	vaccine	-96719740408441346

1342	1342	239	American journal of physiology. Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology	The Vitamin D-Folate Hypothesis in Human Vascular Health.	The vitamin D-folate hypothesis has been proposed as an explanation for the evolution of human skin pigmentation. According to this hypothesis, a darkened skin pigment was adapted by early human populations living in equatorial Africa to protect against photodegradation of bioavailable folate by ultraviolet radiation (UVR). As humans moved away from the equator to more northern latitudes and occupied regions of lower UVR exposure and greater seasonal variation, however, depigmentation occurred to allow for adequate biosynthesis of vitamin D. Vitamin D and folate are both recognized for their evolutionary importance in healthy pregnancy and early childhood development. More recently, evidence has emerged demonstrating the importance of both vitamin D and folate in vascular health via their effects in reducing oxidative stress and improving nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Thus, populations with darkened skin pigmentation may be at elevated risk of vascular dysfunction and cardiovascular disease in low UVR environments due to hypovitaminosis D; particularly important as darkly-pigmented African Americans represent an at-risk population for cardiovascular disease. Conversely, lightly-pigmented populations in high UVR environments may be at risk of deleterious vascular effects of UVR-induced folate degradation. The focus of this review is to explore the currently available literature regarding the potential role of UVR in vascular health via its differential effects on vitamin D and folate metabolism, as well as the interaction between skin pigmentation, genetics, and environment in modulating the vascular influence of UVR exposure.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31314544	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314544	stress	-1556169727291354289

In China, poor cardioprotective medication adherence is a key reason for the high mortality rate of coronary heart disease (CHD). The aims of this systematic review are to (1) describe and synthesise factors that influence medication adherence among Chinese people with CHD, (2) evaluate the current status of intervention studies, and (3) discuss directions of future research to improve medication adherence. A comprehensive search using PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, Scopus, Global Health and PsycINFO was undertaken to describe poor adherence in China. Thirty-three eligible articles were included in the study. The review shows that there are multiple contributing factors to poor medication adherence, including patients' sociodemographic characteristics, health status and medication characteristics. In addition, from patients' perspective, lack of medication-related knowledge, such as the name, function, dosage and frequency, contributes to poor adherence. From physicians' perspective, a gap exists between CHD secondary prevention guidelines and clinical practice in China. Follow-up phone calls, educational lectures, booklets and reminder cards were common methods found to be effective in improving medication adherence. This systematic review indicates that cardioprotective medications were commonly prescribed as secondary prevention medication to patients with CHD in China, but adherence to these medications gradually decreased during a follow-up period. Therefore, more research should be conducted on how to establish high-quality health educational programmes aimed at increasing patients' medication adherence.	2019	eng	Systematic Review	England	31297162	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297162	heart+disease	-1701416312023927957

Independent t-tests and chi square tests showed demographic, health behaviours, and physical illness differed between those with and without depression and/or anxiety. Heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, cancer, arthritis, chronic neck and/or back pain, and asthma were significantly higher in participants diagnosed with depression and/or anxiety. Binary logistic regression showed the strongest predictor of chronic illness was having a diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety. Depression and anxiety present major health problems impacting a considerable proportion of the population. A greater understanding of the associated physical health issues should provide impetus to broaden the physical health and mental illness research agenda to include these diagnoses.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31283353	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31283353	heart+disease	-3581194288660477595

"Nearly 90% of diarrhea-related mortalities are the result of unsafe drinking water, poor sanitation, and insufficient hygiene. Although ""Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene"" (WASH) interventions may significantly reduce the risk of diarrheal disease, it is currently unclear which interventions are the most effective. In this study, we aim to determine the importance of contextualizing a WASH intervention to the local context and the needs for increasing impact (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03709368). A total of 1500 households in rural Tanzania will participate in this cluster randomized controlled trial. Households will be randomized into one of three cohorts: (1) a control group receiving a basic intervention and 1 placebo household visit, (2) an intervention group receiving a basic intervention + 9 additional household visits which are contextualized to the setting using the RANAS approach, and (3) an intervention group receiving a basic intervention + 9 additional household visits, which are not contextualized, i.e., a general intervention. Assessments will take place at a baseline, 1 and 2 years after the start of the intervention, and 1 year after the completion of the intervention. Measurements involve questionnaires and spot checks. The primary outcome is hand-washing behavior, secondary objectives include, the impact on latrine use, health, WASH infrastructure, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness."	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31311186	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311186	Diarrhea	6062146090334604102

Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an emerging and/or re-emerging disease of pigs in several countries, with high morbidity and mortality in suckling piglets. Farms affected with PED perform various intervention practices to control and/or eliminate the PED virus. The objectives of the present study were to assess the effect of biosecurity measures and intervention practices to control PED on time to absence of clinical signs (TAC) and number of dead suckling piglets during TAC. A questionnaire was administered to 120-PED affected farms located across Japan between 2013, when the first case was reported in Japan, and 2014. Farms were asked to provide information on farm characteristics and internal or external biosecurity measures during PED outbreak, as well as on intervention practices to control PED. The TAC was defined as the number of days from the date that clinical PED signs appeared to the date that clinical PED signs disappeared. The number of dead piglets per sow (DP/S) was calculated as the number of dead suckling piglets during TAC divided by the sow inventory. Regarding the effect of biosecurity measures during PED outbreak on TAC and DP/S, longer TAC was observed in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae-positive farms and farms outsourcing pig transport to the slaughterhouse (p <  0.05). In addition, farms with divided truck entrances had lower DP/S than those without divided entrances (p <  0.05).Regarding the effect of intervention practices to control PED on TAC and DP/S, farms that performed feedback at 2 weeks or later after PED outbreak had longer TAC and higher DP/S than other farms (p <  0.05). Farms that fixed the hours staff worked in farrowing barn had lower DP/S than the other farms (p <  0.05). In conclusion, variables associated with long TAC were Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae -positive farms, farms outsourcing pig transport to the slaughterhouse, and farms performing feedback at 2 week or later after PED outbreak. Additionally, those associated with high DP/S were farms without divided entrances, farms without a fixed hours worked in the barn, and farms that performed feedback at 2 week or later after PED outbreak.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31311633	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311633	Diarrhea	-4888170580455425266

Herein, we investigated the distribution of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) in the tissues of wheat grown on DBP-contaminated soils and determined the activity of detoxifying enzymes [cytochrome P450 (P450) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)] in these tissues at different growth stages of wheat. The content of DBP in wheat grown on all soil types increased with increasing DBP stress concentration, and the DBP content of each tissue decreased as wheat growth progressed. Under the same conditions, the DBP content of roots exceeded that of leaves and stems, and the DBP content of all tissues decreased in the order of brown soil > fluvo-aquic soil > cinnamon soil. The decrease of DBP content with growth and the content of mono-n-butyl dicarboxylate (MBP, main metabolite of DBP) followed the order of cinnamon soil > fluvo-aquic soil > brown soil; the latter parameter initially increased and then decreased as growth progressed.

High triglycerides (TG), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and high non-HDL-C levels are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear whether the combinations of their adverse changes are related with CVD risk in different gender and diabetes status, particularly in Chinese population. This study aims to evaluate the CVD risk associated with different adverse lipid combinations. A total of 38,989 participants from Chinese Multicenter Longitudinal Health Management Cohorts (mean age 42 years; 62% male) without baseline CVD were followed up for incident CVD from 2007 to 2015. Participants with various combinations of baseline TG, non-HDL-C, and HDL-C levels within- or out of range according to Adult Treatment Panel III were grouped into 8 distinct lipid categories. Cox models estimated the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of different lipid categories for CVD. After multivariable adjustment, a low level of HDL-C combined with either a high level of non-HDL-C alone or TG alone were associated with increased CVD risk with adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of 1.77 (1.36 to 2.30) and 2.08 (1.30 to 3.34) in male participants. Diabetic participants with high non-HDL-C and low HDL-C levels (adjusted HR 2.93, 95% CI 1.15 to 7.46), and non-diabetic participants with high TG and low HDL-C levels (adjusted HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.26) had greater risk of incident CVD. These relations remained significant when limited analysis to participants with normal LDL-C levels of <3.4 mmol/L, indicating the various combinations of out-of-range lipid profiles other than LDL-C are associated with different CVD risk and the associations depend on gender and glycemic status.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31311663	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311663	diabetes	-873780453963615794

The future of medicine lies in disease modification and prevention. The science of preclinical detection is young, but moving rapidly. Preclinical interventions offer the hope to decrease the severity of a disease or delay the development of a disorder substantially. With such promise, the research and practice of detecting brain disorders at a preclinical stage present unique ethical challenges, challenges that must be addressed to ensure the benefit of these technologies. Direct brain interventions have potential to impact not just what a patient has but who they are and who they could become. Further receiving an assessment for a preclinical or prodromal state has potential to impact perceptions about capacity, autonomy and personhood and could become entangled with stigma and discrimination. Discussion of the risks and benefits of the emerging technology will focus on how to ensure beneficence by presenting the limitations of preclinical detection and by contextualizing the risk associated with preclinical status. Exploring ethical issues alongside and integrated into the experimental design and research of these technologies is critical. This review will highlight ethical issues attendant to the current and near future states of preclinical detection across the life span, specifically as it relates to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31221862	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31221862	Alzheimer	-5363263367015469934

Several studies have found a strong correlation between this method and other methods of equivalence. This method also has limitations. First, the DDDs were not established for the purpose of therapeutic equivalences. Secondly, the daily dose can be applied mainly to the efficacy of the drug, when the dose could cause some adverse effects.The establishment of therapeutic equivalences may help when a clinician needs to change one long-term antipsychotic. This could reduce psychotic relapses. It may enhance therapeutic adherence avoiding undesirable side effects.

Schistosoma mekongi is one of the major causative agents of human schistosomiasis in Southeast Asia. Praziquantel is now the only drug available for treatment and there are serious concerns about parasite resistance to it. Therefore, a dataset of schistosome targets is necessary for drug development. Phosphorylation regulates signalling pathways to control cellular processes that are important for the parasite's growth and reproduction. Inhibition of key phosphoproteins may reduce the severity of schistosomiasis. In this research, we studied the phosphoproteomes of S. mekongi male and female adult worms by using computational and experimental approaches. Using a phosphoproteomics approach, we determined that 88 and 44 phosphoproteins were male- and female-biased, respectively. Immunohistochemistry using anti-phosphoserine antibodies demonstrated phosphorylation on the tegument and muscle of male S. mekongi worms and on the vitelline gland and gastrointestinal tract of female worms. This research revealed S. mekongi sex-dependent phosphoproteins. Our findings provide a better understanding of the role of phosphorylation in S. mekongi and could be integrated with information from other Schistosoma species to facilitate drug and vaccine development.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31292487	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292487	vaccine	-8120372343967636100
1370	1370	321	Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners	Understanding the genetics of asthma and implications for clinical practice.	Asthma is one of the most common heritable diseases globally, with variable clinical expression and response to treatment that is attributed to underlying genetic differences. Hundreds of loci on multiple chromosomes are associated with asthma. Although routine genetic screening is not recommended, testing for medication responsiveness might soon play a role in clinical management. Pharmacogenetic research remains early stage but has demonstrated potential for both clinical and cost effectiveness. Furthermore, recognition of clinically apparent asthma phenotypes, the result of genetic and environmental interactions, can help to inform treatment decisions. Phenotypes are divided into two broad categories of atopic and nonatopic disease, with further subdivisions that are associated with clinical presentation patterns and responsiveness to treatment. In general, earlier onset and allergic disease will respond well to traditional therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and leukotrienes because these medications target inflammatory pathways for allergic disease. However, patients with late-onset, symptom predominant (lacking inflammation), and obese asthma might be resistant to standard therapy and may require treatment modification. These patients are at risk for overuse of ICSs with poor response and may benefit more by use of long-acting beta agonists, long-acting muscarinic agonists, weight reduction, and exercise.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31290808	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31290808	asthma	-5322047011520469406
1371	1371	223	ACS chemical neuroscience	Signaling properties of structurally diverse kappa opioid receptor ligands: towards in vitro models of in vivo responses.	Biased ligands preferentially activate certain signaling pathways downstream of their target receptor, leading to differential physiological or behavioral responses downstream. The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) is a drug target for diseases involving mood and reward, such as depression and addiction. Biased KOR ligands offer the potential to overcome negative side effects that have hampered therapeutic development of KOR agonists in the past, by preferentially activating certain signaling pathways. Understanding relationships between ligand bias and behavior is difficult, however, because differences in cellular context and bias quantification methods lead to variation between studies. Here, a set of 21 structurally diverse kappa opioid receptor (KOR) ligands were tested in parallel, in order to more systematically quantify ligand bias at the KOR. Compounds included the endogenous peptide ligand Dynorphin A(1-17), two novel compounds synthesized for our research, and 18 additional compounds of different structural classes including morphinans and the natural product Salvinorin A. Compounds were tested for their activity in early KOR signaling pathways (G-protein and β-arrestin recruitment) in KOR-expressing U2OS cells, and ligand bias was calculated. A subset of compounds were tested for sedative properties in the rotarod assay in mice. We found that rotarod sedation significantly correlated with β-arrestin signaling in this system, indicating that this in vitro system can be used to accurately describe this in vivo behavior caused by KOR agonists. Additionally, downstream signaling pathways ERK1/2 and mTOR were evaluated, and we determined that signaling via both of these pathways could diverge from KOR-mediated G-protein and arrestin signaling in this system.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313902	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313902	depression	-5193720747719231594

Notably, 5XFAD mice lacking MHCII exhibited an enhanced amyloid pathology in the brain along with exacerbated innate inflammation and reduced phagocytic capacity. Using a bone marrow chimera mouse model, we showed that infiltrating macrophages did not differentiate to MHCII+ cells following ICV injection of Aβ-Th1 cells and did not support T cell-mediated amyloid clearance. Overall, we demonstrate that CD4 T cells induce a P2ry12+ MHCII+ subset of microglia, which play a key role in T cell-mediated effector functions that abrogate AD-like pathology.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31203186	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31203186	Alzheimer	319340024738595907

1375	1375	271	Environmental toxicology	Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) increase rage signaling to promote downstream cardiovascular remodeling.	Exposure to environmental contaminants and consumption of a high, saturated fatty diet has been demonstrated to promote precursors for metabolic syndrome (hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia). The purpose of this study was to determine if exposure to the most prevalent environmental persistent organic pollutants (POPs) would act as causative agents to promote metabolic syndrome independent of dietary intake. We hypothesized that POPs will activate the advanced glycated end-product (AGE)-and receptor for AGE (RAGE) signaling cascade to promote downstream signaling modulators of cardiovascular remodeling and oxidative stress in the heart. At 5-weeks of age nondiabetic (WT) and diabetic (ob/ob) mice were exposed POPs mixtures by oral gavage twice a week for 6-weeks. At the end of 6-weeks, animals were sacrificed and the hearts were taken for biochemical analysis. Increased activation of the AGE-RAGE signaling cascade via POPs exposure resulted in elevated levels of fibroblast differentiation (α-smooth muscle actin) and RAGE expression indicated maladaptive cardiac remodeling. Conversely, the observed decreased superoxide dismutase-1 and -2 (SOD-1 and SOD-2) expression may exacerbate the adverse changes occurring as a result of POPs treatment to reduce innate cardioprotective mechanisms. In comparison, ventricular collagen levels were decreased in mice exposed to POPs. In conclusion, exposure to organic environmental pollutants may intensify oxidative and inflammatory stressors to overwhelm protective mechanisms allowing for adverse cardiac remodeling.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313498	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313498	stress	-3915769742442748515

BACKGROUND Serum sodium (Na) is considered to reflect the severity of liver cirrhosis. In the last few years, much effort has been made to integrate this association into prognostic models after liver transplantation. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between peritransplant Na and neurological complications, as well as short-term survival, after liver transplantation. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 306 liver transplantations between 2012 and 2015 were evaluated. Pre- and posttransplant sodium concentrations were investigated with regard to 3-month survival and incidence of posttransplant neurological complications, along with other factors present in the operative side of the recipient and donor. RESULTS The 3-month survival rate was 94%. Neither hyponatremia (<130 mEq/L) nor hypernatremia (>145 mEq/L) at pretransplantion predicted 3-month survival. A large amount of intraoperative blood transfusion and a large delta Na showed a significant association with poor outcomes at 3 months. On multivariate analysis, the requirement of blood transfusion and warm ischemia time remained independent prognostic factors for 3-month mortality. Hyponatremia and a large delta Na tended to lead to the frequent development of neurological complications. These complications, secondary to rapid Na correction, were concerning and potentially led to a prolonged hospital stay and early mortality. CONCLUSIONS Rapid change in the sodium level might be caused by large amounts of blood transfusion products. This leads to a diminished short-term survival, as well as a higher rate of neurological complications.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31308357	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308357	Cirrhosis	-9019582414165805420

International evidence shows that lifestyle interventions can effectively reduce the risk of developing diabetes in people with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia (NDH). A candidate intervention that has potential to be rolled out at population level is health coaching. Digital interventions offer the means to potentially enhance user satisfaction with health coaching and improve efficiencies. We used a randomised controlled trial to test whether a digitally-enabled health coaching intervention that included an online dashboard and telephone health coaching improved user satisfaction and cost-efficiencies compared with a telephone only health coaching intervention. The primary outcome was satisfaction measured by Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8). 103 participants with NDH were allocated to the telephone coaching only intervention and 106 participants with NDH were allocated to the digital and telephone coaching intervention. In an intention-to-treat analysis satisfaction was higher in participants allocated to the digital and telephone coaching intervention than those allocated to the telephone only intervention, but the difference was not significant. There were no significant differences between the groups on secondary outcomes (HbA1c, BMI, activation, depression, self-management, health status). From a service commissioning perspective the mean incremental cost of the digitally-enabled intervention was £236 ($332; €270). Call times, including administration, were longer for participants allocated to the digitally-enabled intervention. The results show that user satisfaction with digitally-enabled intervention is broadly equivalent with that of telephone delivered interventions in the context of routinely delivered diabetes prevention programmes. There is scope for future work that assesses how economies of scale can be achieved at larger user bases.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31304355	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304355	depression	-3883591366197282127

The left atrial appendage (LAA) is a small, finger-like extension of the left atrium and its exclusion is used as a treatment strategy to prevent ischemic stroke. Existing holdfast devices may damage the tissue, are unisized and not adjustable. A novel holdfast device for LAA exclusion devoid of these shortcomings was designed and 3D-printed using the Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) technology with polyamide powder and tested it on animal model. We selected the SLS 3D printing technology due to its wid14e availability and low production costs which could provide on-site 3D printing for specific patient. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biocompatibility of the reported holdfast device and compare the histological results obtained for local tissue reactions to those obtained for an established grafting material. Thirty swine subdivided into two groups were examined. The LAA exclusion device was implanted and was either coated with a polyester vascular implant or not coated at all and the histological response to the device's presence was evaluated which is a standard approach to test the device biocompatibility. In all cases, complete occlusion was seen without any pathological findings during the incubation time. In both groups, the surface of the atrium under a holdfast device was smooth and shiny and had no clots. The foreign body reaction of the LAA holdfast device made of polyamide powder was insignificantly lower compared to the polyester graft. Thus, it fulfils the parameters of biocompatibility at the highest degree, and makes it suitable material for the manufacturing of LAA holdfast devices.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31309369	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309369	stroke	1797761064772338938

It can be based on various criteria such as face image, DNA methylation, chest plate radiographs, knee radiographs, dental images and etc. Most of the age prediction researches have mainly been based on images. Since the image processing and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have grown up, the investigations were led to use them in age prediction problem. The implementations would be used in different fields, especially in medical applications. Brain Age Estimation (BAE) has attracted more attention in recent years and it would be so helpful in early diagnosis of some neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, etc. BAE is performed on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images to compute the brain ages. Studies based on brain MRI shows that there is a relation between accelerated aging and accelerated brain atrophy. This refers to the effects of neurodegenerative diseases on brain structure while making the whole of it older. This paper reviews and summarizes the main approaches for age prediction based on brain MRI images including preprocessing methods, useful tools used in different research works and the estimation algorithms. We categorize the BAE methods based on two factors, first the way of processing MRI images, which includes pixel-based, surface-based, or voxel-based methods and second, the generation of ML algorithms that includes traditional or Deep Learning (DL) methods. The modern techniques as DL methods help MRI based age prediction to get results that are more accurate. In recent years, more precise and statistical ML approaches have been utilized with the help of related tools for simplifying computations and getting accurate results. Pros and cons of each research and the challenges in each work are expressed and some guidelines and deliberations for future research are suggested.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31297614	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297614	aging	-8757701761088346244

Alzheimer's disease (AD) subtypes have been described according to genetics, neuropsychology, neuropathology, and neuroimaging. Thirty-one patients with clinically probable AD were selected based on perisylvian metabolic decrease on FDG-PET. They were compared to 25 patients with a typical pattern of decreased posterior metabolism. Tree-based machine learning was used on those 56 images to create a classifier that was subsequently applied to 207 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) patients with AD. Machine learning was also used to discriminate between the two ADNI groups based on neuropsychological scores. Compared to AD patients with a typical precuneus metabolic decrease, the new subtype showed stronger hypometabolism in the temporoparietal junction. The classifier was able to distinguish the two groups in the ADNI population. Both groups could only be distinguished cognitively by Trail Making Test-A scores. This study further confirms that there is more than a typical metabolic pattern in probable AD with amnestic presentation.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31243829	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31243829	Alzheimer	-447851796385928420

In this article, the authors describe a new theory, the Evaluative Space Approach to Challenge and Threat (ESACT). Prompted by the Biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat (BPS: Blascovich and Tomaka, 1996) and the development of the Theory of Challenge and Threat States in Athletes (Jones et al., 2009), recent years have witnessed a considerable increase in research examining challenge and threat in sport. This manuscript provides a critical review of the literature examining challenge and threat in sport, tracing its historical development and some of the current empirical ambiguities. To reconcile some of these ambiguities, and utilizing neurobiological evidence associated with approach and avoidance motivation (c.f. Elliot and Covington, 2001), this paper draws upon the Evaluative Space Model (ESM; Cacioppo et al., 1997) and considers the implications for understanding challenge and threat in sport. For example, rather than see challenge and threat as opposite ends of a single bipolar continuum, the ESM implies that individuals could be (1) challenged, (2) threatened, (3) challenged and threatened, or (4) neither challenged or threatened by a particular stimulus. From this perspective, it could be argued that the appraisal of some sport situations as both challenging 	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31312151	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312151	stress	-324861070284719256

Exposure to maternal diabetes during pregnancy results in diabetes in offspring, but its underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated the phenotype and molecular defects of the offspring of poorly controlled diabetic female mice generated by streptozotocin (STZ) administration. Offspring was exposed to maternal diabetes during pregnancy and lactation. The body weight of STZ offspring was lower than that of control offspring at birth and in adulthood, and glucose tolerance was impaired in adult STZ offspring. Interestingly, the phenotype was more pronounced in male offspring. We next investigated the morphology of islets and expression of β cell-related genes, but no significant changes were observed. However, transcriptome analysis of the liver revealed activation of the fork head box protein O1 (Foxo1) pathway in STZ male offspring. Notably, two key gluconeogenesis enzyme genes, glucose 6 phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6pc) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pck1), were upregulated. Consistent with this finding, phosphorylation of Foxo1 was decreased in the liver of STZ male offspring. These changes were not obvious in female offspring. The activation of Foxo1 and gluconeogenesis in the liver may have contributed to the impaired glucose tolerance of STZ male offspring.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31308441	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308441	diabetes	-5204755921272353160

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is an increasingly recognized heart disease that was initially regarded as a benign condition, but since has proven to cause irreversible myocardial damage, resembling that of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The etiology of TTS is still uncertain but may be associated with catecholamine elevations during times of emotional or physical stress. Catecholamines are also understood to have prothrombotic properties, which could lead to ACS. With these similarities, differentiating these two pathologies can be difficult, especially when TTS and ACS occur simultaneously.	2019	eng	Case Reports	United States	31281681	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31281681	heart+disease	-3590865837401183812

In the non-human immunodeficiency virus infected population, cryptococcosis occurs primarily in people who are functionally immunosuppressed, including patients who have undergone solid organ transplantation requiring immunosuppressive medications, are on corticosteroids, or have renal failure or cirrhosis. Cryptococcal meningitis poses a particular challenge in the setting of cirrhosis because its clinical presentation can mimic hepatic encephalopathy. Here, we describe two patients with decompensated cirrhosis, both with a known history of hepatic encephalopathy who had lumbar punctures and were found to have cryptococcal meningitis. The first patient had a subacute fluctuating change in mental status, while the second patient had progressive subacute headaches, gait disturbance, and hearing loss. Both patients were treated with amphotericin B and flucytosine induction, but only the second survived to maintenance therapy. These cases demonstrate the importance of having a high index of suspicion for cryptococcal meningitis in cirrhosis and having a low threshold for performing a lumbar puncture when altered mental status or other neurologic complaints are not fully explained by hepatic encephalopathy. We also provide a brief review of the pathobiology of cryptococcal infection in cirrhosis and highlight the challenges in therapy.	2019	eng	Case Reports	China	31293920	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293920	Cirrhosis	-5060993828460133882
1399	1399	728	Molecular aspects of medicine	Contribution of brown adipose tissue to human energy metabolism.	"The present ""obesogenic' environment has favored excessive energy intake resulting in the current obesity epidemic and its associated diseases. The epidemic has incentivized scientists to develop novel behavioral and pharmacological strategies that enhance energy expenditure to compensate for excessive energy intake. Although physical activity is effective to increase total energy expenditure, it is insufficient to induce negative energy balance and weight loss. With the discovery of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans, BAT activation soon emerged as a potential strategy for elevating energy expenditure. BAT is the only tissue that expresses uncoupling protein 1, conferring on this tissue high thermogenic capacity due to a low efficiency for mitochondrial ATP generation. Potential manipulation of BAT mass and activity has fueled the interest in altering whole-body energy balance through increased energy expenditure. Remarkable advances have been made in quantifying the amount and activity of BAT in humans. Many studies have concluded that the amount of active BAT appears insufficient to induce meaningful increases in energy expenditure. Thus, the majority of studies report that BAT activation does not influence body weight and metabolic control in humans. Strategies to increase BAT mass and/or to potentiate BAT activity seem necessary."	2019	eng	Review	England	31306668	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306668	obesity	4300652811307550975

Daratumumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting CD38, is approved as monotherapy and in combination regimens for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Currently, daratumumab is administered IV. The phase 1b PAVO (MMY1004) study evaluated subcutaneously administered daratumumab in combination with the recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 enzyme (rHuPH20) in patients with relapsed or refractory MM (RRMM). Part 1 of the study, reported here, evaluated a mix-and-deliver (MD) formulation of daratumumab and rHuPH20 (DARA-MD) administered by subcutaneous infusion. Patients received subcutaneous daratumumab per the approved IV monotherapy dosing schedule at 1,200 mg (n=8) or 1,800 mg (n=45). Primary endpoints were safety and pharmacokinetics. The most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with DARA-MD 1,200 mg were thrombocytopenia, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), insomnia, and decreased appetite (37.5% each). Anemia (33.3%), URTI, pyrexia, and diarrhea (26.7% each) were the most common TEAEs with DARA-MD 1,800 mg. One patient in the 1,200 mg dose group (12.5%) and 11 patients in the 1,800 mg dose group (24.4%) experienced infusion-related reactions, which were generally grade 1-2 and typically occurred at the first infusion. The 1,800 mg dose achieved similar or greater serum concentrations compared to the 16 mg/kg IV dose. Overall response rates of 25.0% and 42.2% were achieved with 1,200 mg and 1,800 mg DARA-MD, respectively. Subcutaneous administration of DARA-MD was well tolerated in patients with RRMM, with the 1,800 mg dose demonstrating pharmacokinetic concentrations and responses consistent with IV daratumumab in a similar patient population.

1402	1402	56	Reviews on environmental health	Agreement between parental and student reports on respiratory symptoms and school environment in young Romanian children - evidence from the SINPHONIE project.	Background Environmental research involving children often relies on the self-report or parental report of symptoms and environmental issues. While previous studies explored the agreements between child and parental reports, few of them were conducted in younger children and in developing countries. In this study, we addressed the research gaps by assessing the agreement between child and parental report on respiratory symptoms and school environment in Romanian primary schools. Methods Two hundred and eighty students from five schools and their parents participated in this study. Information on child's respiratory symptoms and perceptions of school environment was collected via both student and parent questionnaires. Agreement between the two questionnaires was assessed by absolute agreement rates and kappa statistics. Prevalence index (PI), bias index (BI) and maximum attainable kappas were calculated to identify potential sources of disagreements. Results The agreement between student and parent questionnaires was low. Compared to the student's report, parents often reported more symptoms than their children, particularly flu-like symptoms, and school environment problems. Parent and child tend to agree when there was no symptom reported, but disagreements often occurred when symptoms were reported. After adjusting for the PI, the agreements for asthma and allergic symptoms improved substantially. Disagreement on reporting of flu-like symptoms was strongly affected by pre-existing causes, such as different understandings of the questions between students and parents. Conclusion Parental report may have a higher sensitivity in capturing a child's respiratory symptoms and school environment problems compared to self-report among young children in developing countries.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31216266	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31216266	flu	-4338308747999225618

Several non-modifiable factors (genetics, age, sex and menopausal status) and lifestyle factors (diet, physical activity, smoking status, obesity, alcohol and medication use) may influence postprandial hypertriglyceridaemia. This narrative review considers the studies published over the last decade that evaluated postprandial hypertriglyceridaemia. Additionally, the genetic determinants of postprandial plasma triglyceride levels, the types of meals for studying postprandial triglyceride response, and underlying conditions (e.g. familial dyslipidaemias, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver and chronic kidney disease) that are associated with postprandial hypertriglyceridaemia are reviewed; therapeutic aspects are also considered.	2019	eng	Review	United Arab Emirates	31309820	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309820	smoking	-5253644367331262405

1412	1412	171	Advances in experimental medicine and biology	Sperm DNA Fragmentation: Mechanisms of Origin.	Spermatozoa have the task to deliver an intact paternal genome to the oocyte and to support a successful embryo development. The high levels of sperm DNA fragmentation (sDF) found in sub-/infertile men threat human reproduction and health of the offspring. Strategies to prevent the onset of this type of sperm damage are extensively sought.sDF can be induced by factors like lifestyle-related habits, diseases, drugs, aging, infections and exposure to pollutants. At the cell level, all these factors induce sperm DNA breaks by three main mechanisms: apoptosis, impairment of sperm chromatin maturation and oxidative stress. Apoptosis and defects in maturation of sperm chromatin appear to act in the testis and account for DNA breaks found in dead ejaculated spermatozoa, whereas oxidative stress is likely inducing sDF during the transit through the male genital tracts and accounting for DNA breaks observed in viable spermatozoa of the ejaculate. Oxidative stress appears to be also the main mechanism responsible for induction of sDF after ejaculation, during in vitro manipulation of spermatozoa. Whether or not mature spermatozoa are able to trigger a cell death program is not yet clarified. In particular, it is not clear whether apoptotic nucleases or reactive oxygen species are responsible for producing DNA breaks in ejaculated mature spermatozoa. Knowledge of the mechanisms inducing sDF is a valuable starting point to define possible therapeutic options that however are still far to be established.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31301047	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301047	aging	4788854083489560153

Frontal infarcts can produce cognitive impairments that affect an individual's ability to function in everyday life. However, the precise types of deficits, and their underlying mechanisms, are not well-understood. Here we used a prefrontal photothrombotic stroke model in C57BL/6J mice to characterise specific cognitive changes that occur in the 6 weeks post-stroke. Behavioural experiments were paired with in vivo electrophysiology to assess whether changes in oscillatory communication between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) mirrored any observed behavioural changes. We found that mice in the stroke group exhibited a delayed onset impairment in tasks of spatial working memory (object location recognition and Y-maze) and that this correlated with reduced PFC-HPC theta band coherence (5-12 Hz) during the task. In the open field, mice in the stroke group exhibited hyperactivity as compared to controls, and stroke animals also exhibited significantly higher beta band activity (13-30 Hz) in the PFC and the HPC. Taken together our results suggest that infarcts in the PFC result in PFC-HPC oscillatory communication changes in the theta and beta bands, correlating with altered performance in spatial memory and open field tasks respectively. Of particular interest, early open field changes in PFC beta band power post-stroke correlated to later-stage spatial memory impairments, highlighting this as a potential biomarker for detecting when spatial memory impairments are likely to occur.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313065	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313065	stroke	3075810310719170278
1414	1414	181	Experimental and therapeutic medicine	Correlation between carotid intima-media roughness and cardiovascular risk factors.	Arterial intima-media roughness (IMR) may indicate an early manifestation of atherosclerosis. To date, few studies have been performed to quantitatively evaluate carotid IMR by ultrasonography (US). The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of cardiovascular risk factors on carotid IMR. A total of 185 subjects were enrolled for US examination of carotid arteries. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and IMR were measured in US images by a novel automatic software. According to the number of combined high-risk factors for coronary heart disease, subjects were assigned to four groups (risk groups 0, 1, 2 and 3+). IMR was lowest in risk group 0 (32.9±2.7 µm), higher in risk group 1 (64.5±6.9 µm; P<0.01 vs. risk group 0) and highest in risk groups 2 and 3+ (89.1±7.4 and 92.0±6.7 µm, respectively; P<0.01 vs. risk groups 0 and 1). According to a multivariate regression analysis, age, systolic blood pressure, smoking status and the triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio were significant predictors of IMR. There was a progressive increase in carotid artery plaque with increasing tertiles of IMR (4.9, 33.9 and 53.2% in tertiles 1, 2 and 3, respectively; P<0.05). Compared with that of subjects in the lowest tertile of IMR, those in the highest tertile had a significantly elevated risk of the presence of plaque in the carotid tree (odds ratio=10.61, 95%CI: 2.15-52.49, P=0.004). Quantification of carotid IMR from US images with this software is feasible, and carotid IMR, which may help estimate the extent of atherosclerosis, may be used as a complementary factor to stratify patients with cardiovascular risk factors.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Greece	31281436	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31281436	heart+disease	3180608611815082945

1416	1416	4	Biotechnology and applied biochemistry	Combinational effect of angiotensin receptor blocker and folic acid therapy on uric acid and creatinine level in hyperhomocysteinemia associated hypertension.	Homocysteine [HSCH2CH2CH(NH2)COOH] (Hcy), is a sulfur-containing amino acid of 135.18 Da of molecular weight, generated during conversion of methionine to cysteine. If there is a higher accumulation of Hcy in the blood, i.e. usually above 15 µmol/L, it leads to a condition referred to as hyperhomocysteinemia. A meta-analysis of observational study suggested an elevated concentration of Hcy in blood, which is termed as the risk factors leading to ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke. Further experimental studies stated that Hcy can lead to an increase in the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and functional impairment of endothelial cells. The analyses confirmed some of the predictors for Hcy presence, such as serum uric acid (UA), systolic blood pressure, and hematocrit. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ARBs) (except losartan) alone are inadequate for controlling UA and creatinine level, although the addition of folic acid may be beneficial in hypertensive patients who are known to have a high prevalence of elevated Hcy. We hypothesized that combination therapy with an ARB (olmesartan) and folic acid is a promising treatment for lowering the UA and creatinine level in hyperhomocysteinemia associated hypertension.

Evidence Before this Study: T cells play an important role in the control of HIV infection and may be particularly useful for HIV-1 cure by killing cells with reactivated HIV-1. Evidence is emerging that not all T-cell responses are protective and mainly only those targeting conserved regions of HIV-1 proteins are effective, but typically immunologically subdominant, while those recognizing hypervariable, easy-to-escape immunodominant 'decoys' do not control viremia and do not protect from a loss of CD4 T cells. We pioneered a vaccine strategy focusing T-cell responses on the most conserved regions of the HIV-1 proteome using an immunogen designated HIVconsv. T cells elicited by the HIVconsv vaccines in HIV-uninfected UK and Kenyan adults inhibited in vitro replication of HIV-1 isolates from 4 major global clades A, B, C and D.Added Value of this Study: The present study demonstrated the concept that epitopes subdominant in natural infection, when taken out of the context of the whole HIV-1 proteome and presented to the immune system by a potent simian adenovirus prime-poxvirus MVA boost regimen, can induce strong responses in patients on antiretroviral treatment and efficiently refocus HIV-1-specific T-cells to the protective epitopes delivered by the vaccine.Implications of all the Available Evidence: Nearly all HIV-1 vaccine strategies currently emphasize induction of broadly neutralizing Abs. The HIVconsv vaccine is one of a very few approaches focussing exclusively on elicitation of T cells and, therefore, can complement antibody induction for better prevention and cure. Given the cross-clade reach on the HIVconsv immunogen design, if efficient, the HIVconsv vaccines could be deployed globally. Effective vaccines will likely be a necessary component in combination with other available preventive measures for halting the HIV-1/AIDS epidemic.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31312806	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312806	vaccine	2809702925357288303

This ability of RV to drive exacerbations typically requires the concomitant presence of exposure to a bystander allergen.

Given these responses, there are several treatments available or being developed that should improve the control of exacerbations related to RV infection.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31284924	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284924	asthma	-4336877432539963613

Substantial progress has been made this century in bringing millions of people living with HIV into care, but progress for early HIV diagnosis has stalled. Individuals first diagnosed with advanced HIV have higher rates of mortality than those diagnosed at an earlier stage even after starting antiretroviral therapy (ART), resulting in substantial costs to health systems. Diagnosis of these individuals is hindered because many patients are asymptomatic, despite being severely immunosuppressed. Baseline CD4 counts and screening for opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis and cryptococcus, is crucial because of the high mortality associated with these co-infections. Individuals with advanced HIV should have rapid ART initiation (except when found to have symptoms, signs, or a diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis) and those in treatment failure should switch treatment. Overcoming barriers to testing and adherence through the development of differentiated care models and providing psychosocial support will be key in reaching populations at high risk of presenting with advanced HIV.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31285181	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285181	tuberculosis	-601952361752157430

The use of biologic agents as therapies for atopic diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis has increased greatly in recent years. The biological agents used to treat atopic diseases are for the most part monoclonal antibodies that suppress the immune response and reduce inflammation by targeting particular cytokines or other molecules involved in Th1, Th2, or Th17 immune reactions. Various side effects and rare complications have been reported from these agents. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of various adverse effects for the biologic agents currently in use or in development for atopic and inflammatory diseases. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the Th1 and Th17 pathways have been associated with significant side effects, partially due to their ability to cause significant impairment in immune responses to pathogens because of the immunologic alterations that they produce. Biologicals targeting Th2-mediated inflammation have had fewer reported side effects, though many are new and emerging drugs whose adverse effects may remain to be fully elucidated with more use. Therefore, continued long-term safety monitoring is required. As with all therapies, the risks associated with side effects of biologics must be balanced against the benefits these drugs offer for treating atopic diseases. One of the most apparent benefits is the steroid-sparing effect of well-chosen biologic therapy used to treat severe atopic disease. In contrast with the quite favorable safety profile of currently available biologics that target the Th2-mediated immune response, chronic systemic corticosteroid use is associated with significant side effects, many of which impact the majority of patients who are placed on long-term steroid therapy.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31301006	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301006	asthma	-4767439283620384185

1431	1431	539	Brain research bulletin	Engineering Biomaterial Microenvironments to Promote Myelination in the Central Nervous System.	Promoting remyelination and/or minimizing demyelination are key therapeutic strategies under investigation for diseases and injuries from multiple sclerosis (MS) to spinal cord injury, stroke, and virus-induced encephalopathy. Myelination is essential for efficacious neuronal signaling. This process is originated by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in the central nervous system (CNS). Resident OPCs are capable of both proliferation and differentiation, and also migration to demyelinated injury sites. OPCs can then engage with these demyelinated axons and differentiate into myelin-forming oligodendrocytes (OLs). However this process is frequently incomplete and often does not occur at all. Biomaterial strategies can now be used to guide OPC and OL development with the goal of regenerating healthy myelin sheaths in formerly damaged CNS tissue. Growth and neurotrophic factors delivered from such materials can promote proliferation of OPCs or differentiation into OLs. While cell transplantation techniques have been used to replace damaged cells in wound sites, they have also led to poor viability, uncontrollable differentiation, and poor integration into the host. Biomaterial scaffolds made from extracellular matrix (ECM) mimics that are naturally or synthetically derived can improve transplanted cell survival, support both transplanted and endogenous cell populations, and direct their fate. In particular, stiffness and degradability of these scaffolds are two parameters that can influence the fate of OPCs and OLs. The future outlook for biomaterials research includes 3D in vitro models of myelination / remyelination / demyelination to better mimic and study these processes. These models should provide simple relationships of myelination to microenvironmental biophysical and biochemical properties to inform improved therapeutic approaches.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31306690	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306690	stroke	-3552937095886146934
1432	1432	498	PloS one	Assay validation and clinical performance of chronic inflammatory and chemokine biomarkers of NASH fibrosis.	Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis, liver transplant, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. While liver biopsy remains the reference standard for disease diagnosis, analytical and clinical development of non-invasive soluble biomarkers of NASH are of great importance to advance the field. To this end, we performed analytical and clinical validation on a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines implicated hepatic inflammation; IL-6, CRP, TNFα, MCP-1, MIP-1β, eotaxin, VCAM-1. Biomarker assays were validated for accuracy and precision. Clinical performance was evaluated in a random sample of 52 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD/NASH. Patients were categorized into three groups according to their fibrosis stage; advanced (F3-F4), mild (F1-2) and no (F0) fibrosis. Serum IL-6 was increased in patients with advanced fibrosis (2.71 pg/mL; 1.26 pg/mL; 1.39 pg/mL p<0.01) compared to patients with mild or no fibrosis respectively. While, there was no significant difference noted in CRP, TNFα, MCP-1, MIP-1β, eotaxin among the three groups, VCAM-1 levels were increased by 55% (p<0.01) and 40% (p<0.05) in the advanced cohort compared to the mild and no fibrosis groups respectively. VCAM-1 also displayed good clinical performance as a biomarker of advanced fibrosis with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.87. The VCAM-1 assay demonstrated robust accuracy and precision, and VCAM-1 outperformed IL-6, CRP, TNFα, and the chemokines MCP-1, MIP-1β, and eotaxin as a biomarker of advanced fibrosis in NASH. Addition of biomarkers such as IL-6 and VCAM-1 to panels may yield increased sensitivity and specificity for staging of NASH.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31291245	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291245	Cirrhosis	-486686184692655504
1433	1433	400	 	Focal Liver Lesions	Contrast-enhanced multiphasic MDCT is the most important liver imaging technique in many institutions. When evaluating solid focal liver lesions, disease characterization is based on assessment of contrast enhancement pattern. If a lesion shows peripheral and nodular enhancement, with the density of enhancing portions similar to the vasculature, a hemangioma can be confidently diagnosed. Arterial phase hypervascular lesions include FNH, adenoma, HCC, and metastases from NET, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and (sometimes) breast cancer. In general, HCC is considered in a setting of cirrhosis or chronic liver disease. An MR examination of the liver routinely includes dynamic contrast-enhanced pulse sequences and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). DWI’s main clinical benefit is the detection of focal liver lesions, which may be missed on conventional and contrast-enhanced imaging sequences. Liver-specific MR contrast agents have been shown to increase the detection of liver metastases and improve the characterization of FNH and adenoma, as well as the characterization of equivocal lesions in cirrhosis.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314381	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314381	Cirrhosis	8920226233198909725

Physician payment models' incentives regarding many aspects of primary health care are not well understood. We focus on the case of medical laboratory utilization and examine how physicians' laboratory test ordering patterns change following a switch to a blended capitation payment model from one with fee for service enhanced with pay for performance. Also, within blended capitation, we examine differences between traditional staffing and interdisciplinary teams. Using a propensity score weighted fixed-effects specification to address selection, it is estimated that the switch to capitation leads to a short-run average of 3% fewer laboratory requisitions per patient. Patients' laboratory utilization also becomes more concentrated with the rostering physician. More importantly, using diabetes-related laboratory tests as a case study, after joining the blended model, physicians order 3% fewer inappropriate/redundant tests, and the addition of an interdisciplinary care team makes the reduction about 9%. Advances in both continuity and quality seem to be associated with blended capitation.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31309648	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309648	diabetes	-3285397592982852407

Despite widened access to HIV testing, around half of those infected worldwide are unaware of their HIV-positive status and linkage to care remains a major challenge. Current rapid HIV tests are typically analogue risking incorrect interpretation, no facile electronic data capture, poor linkage to care and data loss for public health. Smartphone-connected diagnostic devices have potential to dramatically improve access to testing and patient retention with electronic data capture and wireless connectivity. We report a pilot clinical study of surface acoustic wave biosensors based on low-cost components found in smartphones to diagnose HIV in 133 patient samples. We engineered a small, portable, laboratory prototype and dual-channel biochips, with in-situ reference control coating and miniaturised configuration, requiring only 6 µL plasma. The dual-channel biochips were functionalized by ink-jet printing with capture coatings to detect either anti-p24 or anti-gp41 antibodies, and a reference control. Biochips were tested with 31 plasma samples from patients with HIV, and 102 healthy volunteers. SH-SAW biosensors showed excellent sensitivity, specificity, low sample volumes and rapid time to result, and were benchmarked to commercial rapid HIV tests. Testing for individual biomarkers found sensitivities of 100% (anti-gp41) and 64.5% (anti-p24) (combined sensitivity of 100%) and 100% specificity, within 5 min. All positive results were recorded within 60 s of sample addition with an electronic readout. Next steps will focus on a smartphone-connected device prototype and user-friendly app interface for larger scale evaluation and field studies, towards our ultimate goal of a new generation of affordable, connected point-of-care HIV tests.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31304317	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304317	HIV	4189221198175710203

A randomized controlled trial was conducted with the experimental group undergoing a Mindfulness Awareness Program (MAP) and an active control group undergoing a Health Education Program (HEP) over a nine month period. Sessions were conducted weekly for the first three months and monthly for the remaining six months. Self-reported questionnaires in English and Chinese were administered through face-to-face interviews to collect data at baseline, three months and nine months. Descriptive statistics and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to analyse data. Fifty-five elderly participants aged sixty and above, were randomized to MAP (N = 28) and HEP (N = 27) programs. Participants in both intervention arms experienced decreases in depressive and anxiety symptoms over the nine-month period. A significant improvement occurred in the HEP group in depression scores at three months and anxiety scores at both three and nine months. There were no statistically significant changes on cognitive function in both groups over the nine-month period. Both the MAP and HEP can benefit the emotional states of community-living elderly with mild cognitive impairment. Our study supports the usefulness of group-based HEP as a low cost intervention for promoting active aging and psychological health in a community setting.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Scotland	31303397	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303397	aging	-820343972901090172
1448	1448	2	 	Focal Liver Lesions	Contrast-enhanced multiphasic MDCT is the most important liver imaging technique in many institutions. When evaluating solid focal liver lesions, disease characterization is based on assessment of contrast enhancement pattern. If a lesion shows peripheral and nodular enhancement, with the density of enhancing portions similar to the vasculature, a hemangioma can be confidently diagnosed. Arterial phase hypervascular lesions include FNH, adenoma, HCC, and metastases from NET, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and (sometimes) breast cancer. In general, HCC is considered in a setting of cirrhosis or chronic liver disease. An MR examination of the liver routinely includes dynamic contrast-enhanced pulse sequences and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). DWI’s main clinical benefit is the detection of focal liver lesions, which may be missed on conventional and contrast-enhanced imaging sequences. Liver-specific MR contrast agents have been shown to increase the detection of liver metastases and improve the characterization of FNH and adenoma, as well as the characterization of equivocal lesions in cirrhosis.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314381	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314381	cancer	-7126520323752764957

The glycocalyx has been identified as a key mechano-sensor of the shear forces exerted by streaming blood onto the vascular endothelial lining. Although the biochemical reaction to the blood flow has been extensively studied, the mechanism of transmission of the haemodynamic shear forces to the endothelial transmembrane anchoring structures and, consequently, to the subcellular elements in the cytoskeleton, is still not fully understood. Here we apply a multiscale approach to elucidate how haemodynamic shear forces are transmitted to the transmembrane anchors of endothelial cells. Wall shear stress time histories, as obtained from image-based computational haemodynamics models of a carotid bifurcation, are used as a load and a continuum model is applied to obtain the mechanical response of the glycocalyx all along the cardiac cycle.

1451	1451	63	PloS one	Effectiveness of zinc supplementation on diarrhea and average daily gain in pre-weaned dairy calves: A double-blind, block-randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.	The objective of this clinical trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of zinc supplementation on diarrhea and average daily weight gain (ADG) in pre-weaned dairy calves. A total of 1,482 healthy Holstein heifer and bull calves from a large California dairy were enrolled at 24 to 48 hours of age until hutch exit at approximately 90 days of age. Calves were block-randomized by time to one of three treatments: 1) placebo, 2) zinc methionine (ZM), or 3) zinc sulfate (ZS) administered in milk once daily for 14 days. Serum total protein at enrollment and body weight at birth, treatment end, and hutch exit were measured. Fecal consistency was assessed daily for 28 days post-enrollment. For a random sample of 127 calves, serum zinc concentrations before and after treatment and a fecal antigen ELISA at diarrhea start and resolution for Escherichia coli K99, rotavirus, coronavirus, and Cryptosporidium parvum were performed. Linear regression showed that ZM-treated bull calves had 22 g increased ADG compared to placebo-treated bulls (P = 0.042). ZM-treated heifers had 9 g decreased ADG compared to placebo-treated heifers (P = 0.037), after adjusting for average birth weight. Sex-stratified models showed that high birth weight heifers treated with ZM gained more than placebo-treated heifers of the same birth weight, which suggests a dose-response effect rather than a true sex-specific effect of ZM on ADG. Cox regression showed that ZM and ZS-treated calves had a 14.7% (P = 0.015) and 13.9% (P = 0.022) reduced hazard of diarrhea, respectively, compared to placebo-treated calves. Calves supplemented for at least the first five days of diarrhea with ZM and ZS had a 21.4% (P = 0.027) and 13.0% (P = 0.040) increased hazard of cure from diarrhea, respectively, compared to placebo-treated calves. Logistic regression showed that the odds of microbiological cure at diarrhea resolution for rotavirus, C. parvum, or any single fecal pathogen was not different between treatment groups. Zinc supplementation delayed diarrhea and expedited diarrhea recovery in pre-weaned calves. Additionally, zinc improved weight gain differentially in bulls compared to heifers, indicating a research need for sex-specific dosing.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31291305	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291305	Diarrhea	1177957942021788639

The multifaceted nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) demands treatment with multitarget-directed ligands to confront the key pathological aberrations. A novel series of triazinoindole derivatives were designed and synthesized. In vitro studies revealed that all the compounds showed moderate to good anti-cholinesterase activity; the most active compound 23e showing IC50 value of 0.56 ± 0.02 μM for AChE and IC50 value of 1.17 ± 0.09 μM for BuChE. These derivatives are also endowed with potent anti-oxidant activity. To understand the plausible binding mode of the compound 23e, molecular docking studies and molecular dynamics simulation studies were performed and the results indicated significant interactions of 23e within the active sites of AChE as well as BuChE. Compound 23e successfully diminished H2O2-induced oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells and displayed excellent neuroprotective activity against H2O2 as well as Aβ-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells in a concentration dependent manner. Furthermore, it did not show any significant toxicity in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells in the cytotoxicity assay. Compound 23e did not show any acute toxicity in mice at doses up to 2000 mg/kg, and significantly reversed scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice model. Additionally, compound 23e showed notable in silico ADMET properties.

Their potential for improving self-management of chronic conditions is significant. Here, we propose a concept of ""prescribable"" mHealth apps, defined as apps that are currently available, proven effective, and preferably stand-alone, i.e., that do not require dedicated central servers and continuous monitoring by medical professionals. Our objectives were to conduct an overview of systematic reviews to identify such apps, assess the evidence of their effectiveness, and to determine the gaps and limitations in mHealth app research. We searched four databases from 2008 onwards and the Journal of Medical Internet Research for systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of stand-alone health apps. We identified 6 systematic reviews including 23 RCTs evaluating 22 available apps that mostly addressed diabetes, mental health and obesity. Most trials were pilots with small sample size and of short duration. Risk of bias of the included reviews and trials was high. Eleven of the 23 trials showed a meaningful effect on health or surrogate outcomes attributable to apps. In conclusion, we identified only a small number of currently available stand-alone apps that have been evaluated in RCTs. The overall low quality of the evidence of effectiveness greatly limits the prescribability of health apps. mHealth apps need to be evaluated by more robust RCTs that report between-group differences before becoming prescribable. Systematic reviews should incorporate sensitivity analysis of trials with high risk of bias to better summarize the evidence, and should adhere to the relevant reporting guideline."	2018	eng	Review	England	31304297	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304297	obesity	6591596441845797769
1457	1457	213	PloS one	Stem cell enriched lipotransfer reverses the effects of fibrosis in systemic sclerosis.	Oro-facial fibrosis in systemic sclerosis (Scleroderma;SSc) has a major impact on mouth function, facial appearance, and patient quality of life. Lipotransfer is a method of reconstruction that can be used in the treatment of oro-facial fibrosis. The effect of this treatment not only restores oro-facial volume but has also been found to reverse the effects of oro-facial fibrosis. Adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) within the engrafted adipose tissue have been shown to be anti-fibrotic in SSc and are proposed as the mechanism of the anti-fibrotic effect of lipotransfer. A cohort of 62 SSc patients with oro-facial fibrosis were assessed before and after stem cell enriched lipotransfer treatment. Clinical evaluation included assessment of mouth function using a validated assessment tool (Mouth Handicap in Systemic Sclerosis Scale-MHISS), validated psychological measurements and pre and post-operative volumetric assessment. In addition, to understand the mechanism by which the anti-fibrotic effect of ADSCs occur, SSc derived fibroblasts and ADSCs from this cohort of patients were co-cultured in direct and indirect culture systems and compared to monoculture controls. Cell viability, DNA content, protein secretion of known fibrotic mediators including growth factor- β1 (TGF β-1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) using ELISA analysis and fibrosis gene expression using a fibrosis pathway specific qPCR array were evaluated. Mouth function (MHISS) was significantly improved (6.85±5.07) (p<0.0001) after treatment. All psychological measures were significantly improved: DAS 24 (12.1±9.5) (p<0.0001); HADS-anxiety (2.8±3.2) (p<0.0001), HADS-depression (2.0±3.1) (p<0.0001); BFNE (2.9 ± 4.3) (p<0.0001); VAS (3.56±4.1) (p<0.0001). Multiple treatments further improved mouth function (p<0.05), DAS (p<0.0001) and VAS (p = 0.01) scores. SSc fibroblast viability and proliferation was significantly reduced in co-culture compared to monoculture via a paracrine effect over 14 days (p < 0.0001). Protein secretion of transforming growth factor (TGF-β1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was significantly reduced in co-culture compared to monoculture (p < 0.0001). Multiple fibrosis associated genes were down regulated in SSc co-culture compared to monoculture after 14 days including Matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMMP-8), Platelet derived growth factor-β (PDGF-β) and Integrin Subunit Beta 6 (ITG-β6). Autologous stem cell enriched lipotransfer significantly improved the effects of oro-facial fibrosis in SSc in this open cohort study. Lipotransfer may reduce dermal fibrosis through the suppression of fibroblast proliferation and key regulators of fibrogenesis including TG-β1 and CTGF. Our findings warrant further investigation in a randomised controlled trial.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31314805	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314805	depression	-3136683414587095274

1463	1463	274	Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology	Diagnostic and Treatment Algorithm for Chronic Nodular Prurigo.	Chronic nodular prurigo (CNPG) is a subtype of chronic prurigo, also described as prurigo nodularis, and a chronic skin condition characterized by intensely pruritic nodular lesions. Although the exact cause of CNPG is unknown, it appears to result from a repetitive itch-scratch cycle induced by neuronal sensitization to chronic pruritus. CNPG is associated with an underlying dermatologic condition in about half of patients, and can also be attributed to systemic, neurologic, psychogenic, or unknown causes. For most patients, multiple underlying causes are identified. Patients with CNPG often experience impaired quality-of-life, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression. To encourage consistent and accurate diagnosis and treatment of CNPG across regions, we are proposing a diagnostic and treatment algorithm, which includes initial assessment of core symptoms, detailed dermatological history and clinical examination, patient-reported outcomes, diagnostic workup, and recommended therapies. This information is supplemented with photographs to illustrate clinical appearance and disease severity. As CNPG is often multifactorial and it can take months to years for lesions to heal, interdisciplinary cooperation and long-term management are important.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31310842	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310842	depression	4751741894255718069

Stress has a negative impact on students' daily lives and can be associated with recurrent pain. School nurses play a key role in supporting young people with stress-related pain. The purpose of this qualitative interview study was to elucidate school nurses' experiences of encountering students with recurrent pain when practicing person-centred care. The school nurses were based at public and private schools and worked with students aged 12-19. Data were collected through interviews with 18 school nurses and analyzed with deductive content analysis. The school nurses felt that actively listening to the students' narratives about daily life with recurrent pain, and co-creation of a health plan, encouraged the students to participate as partners in their own care and strengthened their relation with the students. The application of a person-centred approach in school health care meant that traditional knowledge transfer was replaced with a dialogue that reflects both the student's and school nurse's perspective.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31311402	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311402	stress	-742603651309629354

1475	1475	114	PloS one	Season and size of urban particulate matter differentially affect cytotoxicity and human immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.	Exposure to air pollution particulate matter (PM) and tuberculosis (TB) are two of the leading global public health challenges affecting low and middle income countries. An estimated 4.26 million premature deaths are attributable to household air pollution and an additional 4.1 million to outdoor air pollution annually. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infects a large proportion of the world's population with the risk for TB development increasing during immunosuppressing conditions. There is strong evidence that such immunosuppressive conditions develop during household air pollution exposure, which increases rates of TB development. Exposure to urban air pollution has been shown to alter the outcome of TB therapy. Here we examined whether in vitro exposure to urban air pollution PM alters human immune responses to M.tb. PM2.5 and PM10 (aerodynamic diameters <2.5μm, <10μm) were collected monthly from rainy, cold-dry and warm-dry seasons in Iztapalapa, a highly populated TB-endemic municipality of Mexico City with elevated outdoor air pollution levels. We evaluated the effects of seasonality and size of PM on cytotoxicity and antimycobacterial host immunity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from interferon gamma (IFN-γ) release assay (IGRA)+ and IGRA- healthy study subjects. PM10 from cold-dry and warm-dry seasons induced the highest cytotoxicity in PBMC. With the exception of PM2.5 from the cold-dry season, pre-exposure to all seasonal PM reduced M.tb phagocytosis by PBMC. Furthermore, M.tb-induced IFN-γ production was suppressed in PM2.5 and PM10-pre-exposed PBMC from IGRA+ subjects. This observation coincides with the reduced expression of M.tb-induced T-bet, a transcription factor regulating IFN-γ expression in T cells. Pre-exposure to PM10 compared to PM2.5 led to greater loss of M.tb growth control. Exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 collected in different seasons differentially impairs M.tb-induced human host immunity, suggesting biological mechanisms underlying altered M.tb infection and TB treatment outcomes during air pollution exposures.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31295271	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295271	tuberculosis	4419562057180692966

"Together with Alzheimer, Parkinson's disease is considered as one of two serious known neurodegenerative diseases. Physicians find it hard to predict whether a given patient has already developed or is expected to develop the Parkinson's disease in the future. To overcome this difficulty, it is possible to develop some computing model which analyzes the data related to a given patient and predicts with acceptable accuracy where he/she will develop the Parkinson's disease. This paper contributes an attractive prediction framework based on some machine learning approaches. Several fuzzy classifiers have been employed in the process to recognize PWP (people with Parkinsonism) from healthy individuals. The fuzzy classified utilized in this study have been tested using the ""Parkinson Speech Dataset with Multiple Types of Sound Recordings Data Set"" available from UCI repository [1]. The results reported by the study described in this paper are better than the results reported in [1], where the same dataset was used but with different classifiers.

Identifying as a 'smoker' has been associated with many cigarette smoking-related behaviors, including less frequent and intense cigarette use. Additional smoking behaviors (e.g., use of cannabis or cigars) also may contribute to self-identification as a 'smoker'. This study compared correlates of identifying as a 'smoker' and measurement strategies for non-daily cigarette consumption among young-adult intermittent and light daily smokers. Using data from Wave 1 of the PATH Study, different measurements of past 30-day non-daily cigarette use were evaluated. Weighted logistic regression models were used to compare associations with self-identification as a smoker among 18-24 year-old intermittent and light daily smokers (n = 1531). Use of other smoked products (combustible tobacco, cannabis) and other documented correlates of smoker identity were evaluated. As frequency of monthly smoking increased, self-identification as a smoker increased (1-5 days = 24%, 6-19 days = 48%, 20-29 days = 78%, light daily smokers = 93%, daily smokers using >5 cigarettes per day = 99%). Self-reported smoking status 12 months ago significantly contributed to current identification as a smoker. Smoking cigars daily or using cannabis in the past 30 days were each positively associated with smoker identity. Different measurement approaches to non-daily cigarette use offer different advantages in terms of interpretability and granularity of information. Compared to daily smokers, non-daily smokers exhibit significant variability in identifying as a smoker, and systematic correlates of smoker identification are apparent. These findings may serve to enhance understanding of non-daily smokers and potential targets for intervention among this growing subpopulation of tobacco users.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31301643	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301643	smoking	3779639438468810958
1487	1487	203	 	The Emerging Theoretical Framework of Life Course Health Development	Concepts of what constitutes health, and theories about how health is produced and optimized, are constantly evolving in response to myriad social and cultural expectations shaped by our contemporary worldview, scientific advances, improvements in health interventions, and the changing capacity of the health system. Stimulated originally by a series of studies demonstrating how growth during early life is related to chronic health conditions that emerge many decades later, new research is demonstrating how complex developmental processes integrate a range of biological, behavioral, social, and environmental influences that modify gene expression, modulate physiologic and behavioral function, and dynamically shape different pathways of health production. These empirical findings are highlighting the limitations of the more mechanistic biomedical and biopsychosocial models of health, which fail to offer comprehensive explanations about such phenomena as the developmental origins of health, how stress affects current and future health, and the consequences of dynamic interactions between individuals and their environments over time. The comfort and certainty of simple, linear, and deterministic causal pathways are giving way to the uncomfortable uncertainty of nonlinear causal clusters that are networked together into complex, multilevel, interactive, and relational systems. Informed by new theoretical perspectives emerging from such fields of study as developmental psychology, systems biology, epigenetics, the developmental origins of chronic disease, and evolutionary developmental biology, a coherent transdisciplinary framework is emerging which we call Life Course Health Development (LCHD) and which is presented in this chapter as a set of seven principles: (1) health development, (2) unfolding, (3) complexity, (4) timing, (5) plasticity, (6) thriving, and (7) harmony. LCHD offers a new perspective that will guide future scientific inquiry on health development and facilitate synthesis of medicine and public health that links treatment, prevention, and health promotion and catalyzes more integrated and networked strategies for designing, organizing, and implementing multilevel health interventions that transcend individual and population dichotomies. We hope that the LCHD framework presented here, coupled with our explanatory narrative, will encourage theory building and testing, inspire innovative transdisciplinary research, and mature the framework into a scientific model with descriptive, explanatory, and predictive utility. Furthermore, we hope that LCHD will shine a light on the conundrum of how little attributable risk is explained in many studies of chronic disease, how early experience conditions future biological response patterns, and how these early experiences play through complex, environmentally influenced, and developmentally plastic health development pathways.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314301	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314301	stress	-4027027091658759481
1488	1488	20	The Journal of biological chemistry	The tumor suppressor RASSF1A modulates inflammation and injury in the reperfused murine myocardium.	Inflammation is a central feature of cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction and heart failure. Reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium triggers a complex inflammatory response that can exacerbate injury and worsen heart function, as well as prevent myocardial rupture and mediate wound healing. Therefore, a more complete understanding of this process could contribute to interventions that properly balance inflammatory responses for improved outcomes.  In this study, we leveraged several approaches including global and regional ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), genetically modified mice, and primary cell culture, to investigate the cell type specific function of the tumor suppressor Ras association domain family member 1 isoform A (RASSF1A) in cardiac inflammation. Our results revealed that genetic inhibition of RASSF1A in cardiomyocytes affords cardioprotection, whereas myeloid-specific deletion of RASSF1A exacerbates inflammation and injury caused by I/R in mice. Cell-based studies revealed that RASSF1A negatively regulates NF-kB and thereby attenuates inflammatory cytokine expression. These findings indicate that myeloid RASSF1A antagonizes I/R-induced myocardial inflammation and suggest that RASSF1A may be a promising target in immunomodulatory therapy for the management of acute heart injury.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31311858	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311858	heart+disease	-8009527121402763559

It is believed than hypothalamus (HTH) might be involved in generation of migraine, and evidence from high resolution fMRI reported that the more anterior part of HTH seemed to play an important role in migraine chronification. The current study was aimed to identify the alteration of morphology and resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of the hypothalamus (HTH) in interictal episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM). High-resolution structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance images were acquired in 18 EM patients, 16 CM patients, and 21 normal controls (NC). The volume of HTH was calculated and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was performed over the whole HTH. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was applied to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of HTH volume. Correlation analyses with clinical variables were performed and FC maps were generated for positive HTH regions according to VBM comparison. The volume of the HTH significantly decreased in both EM and CM patients compared with NC. The cut-off volume of HTH as 1.429 ml had a good diagnostic accuracy for CM with sensitivity of 81.25% and specificity of 100%. VBM analyses identified volume reduction of posterior HTH in EM vs. NC which was negatively correlated with headache frequency. The posterior HTH presented decreased FC with the left inferior temporal gyrus (Brodmann area 20) in EM. Decreased volume of anterior HTH was identified in CM vs. NC and CM vs. EM which was positively correlated with headache frequency in CM. The anterior HTH presented increased FC with the right anterior orbital gyrus (AOrG) (Brodmann area 11) in CM compared with NC and increased FC with the right medial orbital gyrus (MOrG) (Brodmann area 11) in CM compared with EM. Our study provided evidence of structural plasticity and FC changes of HTH in the pathogensis of migraine generation and chronification, supporting potential therapeutic target toward the HTH and its peptide.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31244765	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244765	headache	4311772163179839306

Lower respiratory infection caused by human pathogens such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant healthcare burden that must be addressed. The preferred options to achieve this goal are usually to develop vaccines for prophylaxis and to develop antiviral small molecules to treat infected patients with convenient, orally administrable drugs. However, developing a vaccine against RSV poses special challenges with the diminished immune system of infants and the elderly, and finding a universal flu vaccine is difficult because the product must target a large array of viral strains. On the other hand, the use of small-molecule antivirals can result in the emergence of resistant viruses as it has well-been reported for HIV, influenza, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). This paper reviews peptide antiviral strategies as an alternative to address these challenges. The discovery of influenza and RSV peptidic fusion inhibitors will be discussed and compared to small molecules in view of escape mutations. The importance of constraining peptides into macrocycles to improve both their inhibitory activity and pharmacological properties will be highlighted.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31293570	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293570	vaccine	4084131344684656470

Spermatogenesis is a highly complex biological process during which germ cells undergo recurrent rounds of DNA replication and cell division that may predispose to random mutational events. Hence, germ cells are vulnerable to the introduction of a range of de novo mutations, in particular chromosomal aberrations, point mutations and small indels. The main mechanisms through which mutations may occur during spermatogenesis are (i) errors in DNA replication, (ii) inefficient repair of non-replicative DNA damage between cell divisions and (iii) exposure to mutagens during lifetime. Any genetic alteration in the spermatozoa, if not repaired/eliminated, can be passed on to the offspring, potentially leading to malformations, chromosomal anomalies and monogenic diseases. Spontaneous de novo mutations tend to arise and accumulate with a higher frequency during testicular aging. In fact, there is an increased incidence of some chromosomal aberrations and a greater risk of congenital disorders, collectively termed paternal age effect (PAE), in children conceived by fathers with advanced age. PAE disorders are related to well-characterized de novo point mutations leading to a selective advantage on the mutant spermatogonial stem cells that cause a progressive enrichment over time of mutant spermatozoa in the testis.The purpose of this chapter is to provide a summary on the spontaneous genetic alterations that occur during spermatogenesis, focusing on their underlying mechanisms and their consequences in the offspring.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31301044	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301044	aging	-3864069617285644895

1502	1502	303	Vaccine	Trials of the killed oral cholera vaccine (Shanchol) in India and Bangladesh: Lessons learned and way forward.	Cholera has been endemic in India and Bangladesh for the greater part of recorded history, giving this region the reputation of being the 'homeland of cholera'. The causative organism Vibrio cholerae O1 has been responsible for large epidemics and pandemics. Bangladesh and India have conducted several sequential studies of Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) to ascertain its safety, efficacy, effectiveness, field feasibility and acceptance in high-risk urban populations. The objective of this article is to illustrate the experience of OCV use in these endemic settings, its major challenges, and how policymakers can grant vaccine licenses as well as implement its use in the national immunization programme. The relevant aspects of the OCV studies, such as boosting the effect of vaccine, single-dose versus double-dose trials and thermal stability of the vaccine during delivery have generated strong evidence for recommendation of vaccine use in these settings. Studies have shown that a single dose is effective for children of five years of age and older age groups. The locally manufactured vaccine in India is thermostable and can be delivered in field settings without use of cold chain. The vaccine delivery is feasible and the protective efficacy (PE) of this vaccine above five years of age against cholera was 53-65%. Administration of an OCV boosting regimen elicits an immune response similar to those who received a two-dose vaccine five years back. OCV can be used as a preemptive measure in endemic settings, in natural calamities and during political instability when there is total disruption as well as collapse of safe water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities and other control measures. Clear identification of areas and target population (who will gain benefit from the OCVs) is required to be developed in endemic settings.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31301917	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301917	vaccine	3205047378909988692
1503	1503	70	Brain : a journal of neurology	Opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels causes migraine attacks: a new target for the treatment of migraine.	Migraine is one of the most disabling and prevalent of all disorders. To improve understanding of migraine mechanisms and to suggest a new therapeutic target, we investigated whether opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) would cause migraine attacks. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 16 patients aged 18-49 years with one to five migraine attacks a month were randomly allocated to receive an infusion of 0.05 mg/min KATP channel opener levcromakalim and placebo on two different days (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03228355). The primary endpoints were the difference in incidence of migraine attacks, headaches and the difference in area under the curve (AUC) for headache intensity scores (0-12 h) and for middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (0-2 h) between levcromakalim and placebo. Between 24 May 2017 and 23 November 2017, 16 patients randomly received levcromakalim and placebo on two different days. Sixteen patients (100%) developed migraine attacks after levcromakalim compared with one patient (6%) after placebo (P = 0.0001); the difference of incidence is 94% [95% confidence interval (CI) 78-100%]. The incidence of headache over the 12 h observation period was higher but not significant after levcromakalim (n = 16) than after placebo (n = 7) (P = 0.016) (95% CI 16-71%). The AUC for headache intensity was significantly larger after levcromakalim compared to placebo (AUC0-12h, P < 0.0001). There was no change in mean middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity after levcromakalim compared to placebo (AUC0-2hP = 0.46). Opening of KATP channels caused migraine attacks in all patients. This suggests a crucial role of these channels in migraine pathophysiology and that KATP channel blockers could be potential targets for novel drugs for migraine.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31292608	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292608	headache	2495913984359439198

The abnormal accumulation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) is recognized as a central component in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. While many aspects of Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity remain elusive, Aβ has been associated with numerous underlying pathologies, including oxidative and nitrosative stress, inflammation, metal ion imbalance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and even tau pathology. Ergothioneine (ET), a naturally occurring thiol/thione-derivative of histidine, has demonstrated antioxidant and neuroprotective properties against various oxidative and neurotoxic stressors. This study investigates ET's potential to counteract Aβ-toxicity in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans overexpressing a human Aβ peptide. The accumulation of Aβ in this model leads to paralysis and premature death. We show that ET dose-dependently reduces Aβ-oligomerization and extends the lifespan and healthspan of the nematodes.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31211853	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211853	Alzheimer	-6592496241044177853

1510	1510	362	Vascular health and risk management	The burden of critical limb ischemia: a review of recent literature.	Peripheral arterial disease is a chronic vascular disease characterized by impaired circulation to the lower extremities. Its most severe stage, known as critical limb ischemia (CLI), puts patients at an increased risk of cardiovascular events, amputation, and death. The objective of this literature review is to describe the burden of disease across a comprehensive set of domains-epidemiologic, clinical, humanistic, and economic-focusing on key studies published in the last decade. CLI prevalence in the United States is estimated to be approximately 2 million and is likely to rise in the coming years given trends in important risk factors such as age, diabetes, and smoking. Hospitalization for CLI patients is common and up to 60% are readmitted within 6 months. Amputation rates are unacceptably high with a disproportionate risk for certain demographic and socioeconomic groups. In addition to limb loss, CLI patients also have reduced life expectancy with mortality typically exceeding 50% by 5 years. Given the poor clinical prognosis, it is unsurprising that the quality of life burden associated with CLI is significant. Studies assessing quality of life in CLI patients have used a variety of generic and disease-specific measures and all document a substantial impact of the disease on the patient's physical, social, and emotional health status compared to population norms. Finally, the poor clinical outcomes and increased medical resource use lead to a considerable economic burden for national health care systems. However, published cost studies are not comprehensive and, therefore, likely underestimate the true economic impact of CLI. Our summary documents a sobering assessment of CLI burden-a poor clinical prognosis translating into diminished quality of life and high costs for millions of patients. Continued prevention efforts and improved treatment strategies are the key to ameliorating the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.	2019	eng	Journal Article	New Zealand	31308682	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308682	diabetes	2668385070649954934

White matter lesions due to cerebral hypoperfusion may be an important pathophysiology in vascular dementia and stroke, although the inherent mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. The present study, using a mouse model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, examined the white matter protective effects of levetiracetam, an anticonvulsant, via the signaling cascade from the activation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. Mice underwent bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS), and were separated into the levetiracetam group (injected once only after BCAS [LEV1] or injected on three consecutive days [LEV3]), the vehicle group, or the anti-epileptic drugs with different action mechanisms phenytoin group (PHT3; injected on three consecutive days with the same condition as in LEV3). Cerebral blood flow analysis, Y-maze spontaneous alternation test, novel object recognition test, immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses, and protein kinase A assay were performed after BCAS. In the LEV3 group, SV2A expression was markedly increased, which preserved learning and memory after BCAS. Moreover, as the protein kinase A level was significantly increased, pCREB expression was also increased. The activation of microglia and astrocytes was markedly suppressed, although the number of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and GST-pi-positive-oligodendrocytes was markedly higher in the cerebral white matter. Moreover, oxidative stress was significantly reduced. We found that 3-day treatment with levetiracetam maintained SV2A protein expression via interaction with astrocytes, which influenced the OPC lineage through activation of CREB to protect white matter from ischemia.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31302262	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302262	stroke	-2549933363319068481
1512	1512	428	Advances in pharmacology (San Diego, Calif.)	Drug-induced liver injury in obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.	Obesity is commonly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), a benign condition characterized by hepatic lipid accumulation. However, NAFL can progress in some patients to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and then to severe liver lesions including extensive fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The entire spectrum of these hepatic lesions is referred to as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The transition of simple fatty liver to NASH seems to be favored by several genetic and environmental factors. Different experimental and clinical investigations showed or suggested that obesity and NAFLD are able to increase the risk of hepatotoxicity of different drugs. Some of these drugs may cause more severe and/or more frequent acute liver injury in obese individuals whereas others may trigger the transition of simple fatty liver to NASH or may worsen hepatic lipid accumulation, necroinflammation and fibrosis. This review presents the available information regarding drugs that may cause a specific risk in the context of obesity and NAFLD. These drugs, which belong to different pharmacological classes, include acetaminophen, halothane, methotrexate, rosiglitazone and tamoxifen. For some of these drugs, experimental investigations confirmed the clinical observations and unveiled different pathophysiological mechanisms which may explain why these pharmaceuticals are particularly hepatotoxic in obesity and NAFLD. Because obese people often take several drugs for the treatment of different obesity-related diseases, there is an urgent need to identify the main pharmaceuticals that may cause acute liver injury on a fatty liver background or that may enhance the risk of severe chronic liver disease.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31307592	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307592	Cirrhosis	-2539915991213675511

Malnutrition is widely prevalent in cirrhosis, which can worsen sarcopenia, hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and the overall prognosis. We aimed to define the frequency of nutritional assessment of cirrhotic patients retrospectively and after training, evaluate prospective changes along with its effect on 90-day readmissions. This study was conducted in two phases. Retrospectively, records of hospitalized cirrhotic patients from University and Veterans Affairs(VA) settings were reviewed to assess nutritional status, if nutrition consult was placed, number of days patients were nil per oral (NPO) and received inadequate nutrition, and if nutritional management was guideline directed. In prospective phase: after dedicated educational efforts directed at the stakeholders regarding cirrhosis nutritional guidelines, subsequently hospitalized cirrhosis patients had nutritional and 90-day readmission data collected for comparison between groups. 279 patients were included in the retrospective (150 University/129 VA) and 102 VA patients were in the prospective phase. Cirrhosis severity, reason for admission, hospital course was similar between groups regardless of prospective/retrospective or VA/University. The prospective group had significantly more nutrition consultations and assessments (74.5% vs 40.1%, p<0.0001) compared to retrospective irrespective of VA/University comparisons. Both groups had similar number of days NPO, but the prospective group had fewer days of inadequate nutrition. 90-day readmissions were significantly lower in the prospective versus retrospective group (39% vs. 28%, p=0.04), associated with greater nutrition outpatient follow-up. In conclusion, nutritional consultation rates in cirrhotic inpatients can be significantly improved after educational intervention, which is associated with lower 90-day readmission rates.

The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with porous zinc oxide (HiZox) on growth performance, intestinal microbiota, morphology, and permeability in weaned piglets. A total of 128 weaned piglets [(Landrace × Yorkshire) × Duroc] with an average body weight (BW) of (6.55 ± 0.25 kg; 21 d of age) were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments: (1) a corn-soybean basal diet; (2) basal diet + 3,000 mg/kg conventional ZnO; (3) basal diet + 200 mg/kg HiZox; (4) basal diet + 500 mg/kg HiZox.

Incremental HiZox in the diet increased ADG (linear p = 0.015; quadratic p = 0.043) and ADFI (linear p = 0.027; quadratic p = 0.038), and the diarrhea index decreased linearly and quadratically (p < 0.01) as HiZox supplemented increased. Furthermore, supplementation with HiZox increased the amounts of Lactobacillus spp. (p < 0.05) in the ileum and cecum in comparison with that of control treatment or 3,000 mg/kg ZnO treatment, while decreased the populations of Escherichia coli, Clostridium coccoides, and Clostridium. leptum subgroup (p < 0.05) in the ileum and cecum relative to those in control treatment. The addition of HiZox increased the villus height and villus-to-crypt ratio (VC) of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum (p < 0.05), while decreased the crypt depth of jejunum (p < 0.05) and tended to reduce the crypt depth of duodenum (p < 0.10) compared with the control treatment. Piglets fed with 500 mg/kg HiZox had lower serum D-lactate and diamine oxidase (DAO) than those fed with basal control diet or 3,000 mg/kg ZnO diet (p < 0.01). The results suggested that supplementation with HiZox modulated intestinal microbial composition and improved intestinal morphology, which may exert protective effects on the integrity of the mucosal barrier function of weaned piglets, was as efficacious as pharmaceutical doses of ZnO in enhancing growth performance, indicating that the HiZox may be a promising alternative to pharmaceutical doses of ZnO.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Australia	31273888	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31273888	Diarrhea	3075564241645350154

The lungs, a special site that is frequently challenged by tumors, pathogens and other environmental insults, are populated by large numbers of innate immune cells. Among these, natural killer (NK) cells are gaining increasing attention. Recent studies have revealed that NK cells are heterogeneous populations consisting of distinct subpopulations with diverse characteristics, some of which are determined by their local tissue microenvironment. Most current information about NK cells comes from studies of NK cells from the peripheral blood of humans and NK cells from the spleen and bone marrow of mice. However, the functions and phenotypes of lung NK cells differ from those of NK cells in other tissues. Here, we provide an overview of human and mouse lung NK cells in the context of homeostasis, pathogenic infections, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, mainly focusing on their phenotype, function, frequency, and their potential role in pathogenesis or immune defense. A comprehensive understanding of the biology of NK cells in the lungs will aid the development of NK cell-based immunotherapies for the treatment of lung diseases.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31293580	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293580	asthma	-1557461511205521728

Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare, chronic vaso-occlusive disease affecting the arteries of the Circle of Willis, leading to the development of characteristic collateral vessels. In this paper, we present a case of a 35-year-old Hispanic male who presented to the emergency department with new onset headaches. On examination, Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3T. The patient was investigated with head CT scan and cerebral angiogram, diagnosed as MMD, and treated with emergent ventriculostomy. Ultimately, the patient underwent extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery for treatment of Moyamoya.	2019	eng	Case Reports	United States	31245213	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31245213	headache	2645380860642118790
1533	1533	404	Pharmacological research	Inflammation within the Neurovascular Unit: Focus on Microglia for Stroke Injury and Recovery.	Neuroinflammation underlies the etiology of multiple neurodegenerative diseases and stroke. Our understanding of neuroinflammation has evolved in the last few years and major players have been identified. Microglia, the brain resident macrophages, are considered sentinels at the forefront of the neuroinflammatory response to different brain insults. Interestingly, microglia perform other physiological functions in addition to their role in neuroinflammation. Therefore, an updated approach in which modulation, rather than complete elimination of microglia is necessary. In this review, the emerging roles of microglia and their interaction with different components of the neurovascular unit are discussed. In addition, recent data on sex differences in microglial physiology and in the context of stroke will be presented. Finally, the multiplicity of roles assumed by microglia in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke, and in the presence of co-morbidities such as hypertension and diabetes are summarized.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31315064	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315064	stroke	-8026099268928087567

"Behavioral health problems affect at least 15% of mothers, but few studies have examined how different problems cluster together. Characterizing symptom profiles and their correlates early in the family life cycle can extend existing understanding beyond that provided by studies based on single problems. Mothers in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study, a national birth cohort of racially diverse and mostly unmarried mothers (N = 4205), reported depression, anxiety, and substance dependence symptoms. Latent class analysis (LCA) identified mothers' symptom profiles in their children's third year. We explored associations between symptom profiles and demographics, reproductive health outcomes, functional limitations, and postpartum behavioral health. LCA identified five profiles: (1) Depression only (14.5% of sample), (2) Severe depression and anxiety (5.3%), (3) Anxiety only (2.2%), (4) Depression and substance use (1.4%), and (5) Currently symptom free (76.6%). Depressive symptoms were more moderate when co-occurring with substance dependence and more severe when co-occurring with anxiety. Postpartum depression, postpartum anxiety, and smoking during pregnancy were the most robust correlates of being symptomatic in year 3. Mothers in the ""Severe depression and anxiety"" group were more likely to be in that profile if they reported functional impairment and/or relationship dissolution. Mothers in the ""Depression only"" profile were more likely to have higher parity and/or functional impairment. A quarter of mothers of young children had significant behavioral health symptoms, with most reporting depression symptoms. Psychosocial and physical health factors in the pregnancy and postpartum periods were associated with future symptoms, warranting obstetrician and pediatrician attention."	2019	eng	Journal Article	Austria	31297651	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297651	smoking	-7862677531530632089

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a heterogeneous and complex disease that is imprecisely diagnosed by liver biopsy. NAFLD covers a spectrum that ranges from simple steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with varying degrees of fibrosis, to cirrhosis, which is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. Lifestyle and eating habit changes during the last century have made NAFLD the most common liver disease linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, with a global prevalence of 25%. NAFLD arises when the uptake of fatty acids (FA) and triglycerides (TG) from circulation and de novo lipogenesis saturate the rate of FA β-oxidation and very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG export. Deranged lipid metabolism is also associated with NAFLD progression from steatosis to NASH, and therefore, alterations in liver and serum lipidomic signatures are good indicators of the disease's development and progression. This review focuses on the importance of the classification of NAFLD patients into different subtypes, corresponding to the main alteration(s) in the major pathways that regulate FA homeostasis leading, in each case, to the initiation and progression of NASH. This concept also supports the targeted intervention as a key approach to maximize therapeutic efficacy and opens the door to the development of precise NASH treatments.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31293337	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293337	Cirrhosis	-2131823791227094865

To explore the potential relationship between dairy product consumption and bladder cancer risk, we retrieved eligible studies published up to March 15, 2018, via online database search and manual review of the selected articles. Summary relative risk (RR) estimates were calculated using random-effects models based on high to low intake values. Inter-study heterogeneity was explored using stratified analyses of study design, geographic region, or whether studies adjusted for the confounders age, sex, body mass index, smoking, and education level. We extracted data from 16 studies on milk (5,193 subjects) and 10 studies on dairy products (20,434 subjects). The total study population included 220,952 individuals. Dairy product intake and bladder cancer risk were significantly associated, and milk intake and bladder cancer risk more so. Stratified analysis revealed that the trend was more pronounced in case-control studies, and in studies with impact factor <3 and in Asia. The relationship was confirmed after adjusting for sex and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale score of 7 and 8. Our study shows an inverse association between milk consumption and bladder cancer risk.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31295044	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295044	smoking	4235212484048164433

Antrodia camphorata is a well-known traditional Chinese mushroom used as a functional food and nutraceutical in Taiwan and China. The aim of this study was to explore the protective effects and mechanism(s) of the ethyl acetate crude extract of A. camphorata (EtOAc-AC) and its active constituent ergostatrien-7,9(11),22-trien-3β-ol (EK100) in an acute ischemic stroke (AIS) murine model. Treating mice with induced AIS injury by using EtOAc-AC (0.3-0.6 g kg-1, p.o.) and EK100 (60 and 120 mg kg-1, p.o.) 2 h after AIS induction significantly increased the tracking distance and reduced brain infarction. Both EtOAc-AC and EK-100 reduced the expression levels of p65NF-κB and caspase 3 near the peri-infarct cortex and promoted the expression of neurogenesis-associated protein doublecortin (DCX) near the hippocampus, accompanied by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) inhibition and β-catenin upregulation. Signaling pathway analysis revealed that the advantageous effects of EtOAc-AC and EK-100 involved triggering the activation of PI3K/Akt and inhibition of GSK-3. Our findings suggest that EtOAc-AC and its active constituent EK100 display anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities. Both EtOAc-AC and EK100 reduce ischemic brain injury by decreasing p65NF-κB and caspase 3 expression, and they promote neurogenesis (DCX) and neuroprotection (Bcl2) by activating the PI3k/Akt-associated GSK3 inhibition and β-catenin activation.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31304955	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304955	stroke	2267321579404324900

Candida albicans (C. albicans) belongs to the opportunistic fungal pathogens, which cause a wide spectrum of infections in immune-compromised patients. Graphene oxide (GO), a biocompatibility agent, has been reported to exhibit effective antimicrobial activity. In the present study, a graphene oxide/fluconazole (GO/Flu) compound was synthesized and characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. The antifungal activity of GO/Flu was examined against fluconazole-resistant C. albicans (ATCC 10231) compared to GO and Flu using the broth microdilution method, according to CLSI protocol. DNA fragmentation was assessed through the antifungal mechanism of GO/Flu. The release of Fluin PBS medium was measured. Moreover, the cytotoxicity effect of GO/Flu on SW480 cell line was evaluated. Indeed, adhesion ability of C. albicans-treated GO/Flu against SW480 cell line was assessed. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of GO, Flu, and GO/Flu was determined at 800 µg/mL, 16 µg/mL, and 400-9 µg/mL, respectively. Notably, GO/Flu exhibited an intense antifungal activity compared to GO and Flu. In addition, GO/Flu showed much less cell toxicity against SW480 cell line than GO and Flu (P < 0.05). The release determination of Flu in PBS (pH 7.4) medium was 72.42%. GO/Flu reduced the adhesion ability of C. albicans to SW480 cell line significantly. DNA fragmentation assay indicated that GO/Flu potentially degraded the DNA of C. albicans and caused a fungicidal influence. According to the findings, GO/Flu could enhance the antifungal activity against C.albicans through DNA fragmentation with low cytotoxicity effect.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	30859396	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30859396	flu	4383035933260676803

This study aims to estimate the economic costs of sickness absenteeism of health care workers in a large Italian teaching hospital during the seasonal flu periods. A retrospective observational study was performed. The excess data of hospital's sickness absenteeism during three seasonal influenza periods (2010/2011; 2011/2012; 2012/2013) came from a previous study. The cost of sickness absenteeism was calculated for six job categories: medical doctor, technical executive (i.e., pharmacists); nurses and allied health professionals (i.e., radiographer), other executives (i.e., engineer), non-medical support staff, and administrative staff, and for four age ranges: <39, 40⁻49, 50⁻59, and >59 years. An average of 5401 employees working each year were under study. There were over 11,100 working days/year lost associated with an influenza period in Italy, the costs associated were approximately 1.7 million euros, and the average work loss was valued at € 327/person. The major shares of cost appeared related to nurses and allied health professionals (45% of total costs). The highest costs for working days lost were reported in the 40⁻49 age range, accounting for 37% of total costs. Due to the substantial economic burden of sickness absenteeism, there are clear benefits to be gained from the effective prevention of the influenza.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	30832264	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832264	flu	8814787788150050622

We have studied the alterations in the use of curative treatment and the outcome for lung cancer patients in Norway 2001-2016. The Cancer Registry of Norway has a practically complete registration of all cancer diagnoses, treatments given and deaths. For the years 2001-2016, 43,137 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer. Stereotactic radiotherapy was established nationwide from 2008 and its use has increased, and in 2016, 8.8% were given this treatment. In addition 20.6% were operated and 8.5% were treated with conventional radiotherapy. Thus 37.9% of those diagnosed were treated with intention to cure, compared to 22.9% in 2001 (p < 0.0001). Further, the median survival for the whole group diagnosed with lung cancer increased from 6.0 (95% CI 5.6-6.7) months in 2001 to 11.8 (95% CI 10.9-12.7) in 2016. The 5 year survival increased from 9.4 (95% CI 8.1-10.8)% to 19.9 (95% CI 19.2-20.6)% in the same period. In 2016 the age adjusted incidence rate was 59.5 per 100,000 (Norwegian standard) and had increased significantly in both sexes. There had also been an increase in mean age at diagnosis and the proportion diagnosed in an early stage. The increase in curative treatment has been paralleled with a doubling in both the median and 5-year survival. The present results are used for surveillance and as a benchmark, and we are looking forward to reaching a proportion of 40% of patients given curative treatment.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31313073	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313073	cancer	-1124738136890721085

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is the fastest-growing indication for the liver transplant and a leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma among patients listed for liver transplantation in the USA. Post-transplant nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis are frequent complications of liver transplantation. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis poses a significant challenge in both pre- and post-transplant period due to its association with metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. While optimal therapy is not yet available in the post-liver transplant setting, lifestyle interventions continue to remain as the mainstay of therapy for post-transplant nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Early recognition with protocol biopsies and noninvasive modalities, along with modification of known risk factors, are the most effective methods to curtail the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in the absence of FDA-approved pharmacologic therapy.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31312990	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312990	Cirrhosis	-3110580810771259448

Therapeutic reversal of immune tolerance following immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPI) administration, has proven effective in prolonging survival of patients with a variety of solid and liquid tumors, often however at the expenses of discrete toxicities known as immune-related adverse events (AEs). Such reactions result from activation of the immune system and often present with generalized symptoms including fatigue or fever and, in some patients, may cause organ-specific damage. Skin, gut, endocrine, lung and musculoskeletal are the most frequent targets of ICPI toxicity whereas, cardiovascular, hematologic, renal, neurologic and ophthalmologic AEs occur much less frequently. While the majority of AEs are mild to moderate, serious, occasionally life-threatening reactions have been reported, including severe colitis, pneumonitis, encephalitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, myocarditis, and diabetic ketoacidosis, with a death toll of 2%. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is becoming an attractive area for immunotherapy. Owing to the fact that the association of HCC with cirrhosis may jeopardize tolerability of ICPI therapy, attention has been paid to identifying, preventing, and treating the AEs associated with ICPI, with a focus on liver safety. Though in most studies AEs resolved with interruption of treatment and short course of steroids, identification of predictive biomarkers of response might help sparing patients from potentially life-threatening toxicity in the absence of clinical benefit.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31296449	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296449	Cirrhosis	3825866166263569974

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been one of the most prevalent metabolic disorders. Nonetheless, the commonly used anti-T2DM drugs failed to substantially treat T2DM, which always rapidly rebound in blood glucose when withdrawal. Here we put forward a superior and sustainable anti-diabetic strategy using intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of amino acid functionalized gadofullerene nanoparticles (GFNPs) in db/db diabetic mice. Highly accumulated into pancreas and liver, GFNPs could prominently decrease hyperglycemia, along with permanently maintained normal blood sugar levels in T2DM mice even stopping administration. Importantly, GFNPs reversed the pancreas islets dysfunctions by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation responses, and fundamentally normalize the insulin secretory function of pancreas islets. Mechanistically, GFNPs improved hepatic insulin resistance by regulating glucose and lipid metabolism through the activation of IRS2/PI3K/AKT signal pathways, resulting in inhibiting gluconeogenesis and increasing glycogenesis in liver. Additionally, GFNPs relieved hepatic steatosis in liver, ultimately maintain systemic glucose and lipid metabolic homeostasis without obvious toxicity. Together, GFNPs reverse the dysfunctions of pancreas and improve hepatic insulin resistance, providing a promising approach for T2DM treatment.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31314991	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314991	stress	-2577148567706202814

However, cases of symptomatic CH that occur secondary to an underlying structural pathology have also been reported in the literature. In this report, seven patients are presented who were admitted with signs of CH and diagnosed with acute rhinosinusitis depending on extensive clinical and radiologic examinations. Symptomatic CH, though rarely reported in the literature compared to CH, should be kept in mind in patients presenting with the first attack of CH. Moreover, in such patients, whether the pain becomes worse when bending forward and becomes sensitive on palpation should be questioned, and a radiologic work-up should be performed to rule out secondary causes such as rhinosinusitis. In the present cases, the resolution of CH attacks with acute sinusitis therapy confirmed the diagnosis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31247057	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31247057	headache	-5255285107284514595

This case demonstrates that workup of stroke should be comprehensive to include all mechanical and anatomic possibilities before investigating rarer hypercoagulable disorders.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31306336	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306336	stroke	4320282974712265321

1564	1564	170	Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B	Multidrug transporters of Candida species in clinical azole resistance.	Over-expression of the human P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in tumor cells is a classic example of an ABC protein serving as a hindrance to effective chemotherapy. The existence of proteins homologous to P-gp in organisms encompassing the entire living kingdom highlights extrusion of drugs as a general mechanism of multidrug resistance. Infections caused by opportunistic human fungal pathogens such as Candida species are very common and has intensified in recent years. The typical hosts, who possess suppressed immune systems due to conditions such as HIV and transplantation surgery etc., are prone to fungal infections. Prolonged chemotherapy induces fungal cells to eventually develop tolerance to most of the antifungals currently in clinical use. Amongst other prominent mechanisms of antifungal resistance such as manipulation of the drug target, rapid efflux achieved through overexpression of multidrug transporters has emerged as a major resistance mechanism for azoles. Herein, the azole-resistant clinical isolates of Candida species utilize a few select efflux pump proteins belonging to the ABC and MFS superfamilies, to deter the toxic accumulation of therapeutic azoles and thus, facilitating cell survival. In this article, we summarize and discuss the clinically relevant mechanisms of azole resistance in Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida (NAC) species, specifically highlighting the role of multidrug efflux proteins in the phenomenon.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31302289	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302289	HIV	-4570752586662989981
1565	1565	419	 	Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: The Overlooked Complication of Type 2 Diabetes	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common complication of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Most times it is an unrecognized comorbidity to the primary care provider and endocrinologist. Today it is the most common chronic liver disease in developed countries. It is characterized by insulin resistance and hepatic triglyceride accumulation in the absence of co-existing etiologies, such as excessive alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis, medications or other etiologies for hepatic steatosis. Its more severe form of the disease with steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with hepatocyte injury (necrosis and inflammation) and frequently with fibrosis. Although it appears to be an indolent condition, with few symptoms and often normal plasma aminotransferases, NASH is a leading cause of end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and significantly increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and T2DM. The pathogenesis of NASH remains poorly understood, and likely to be multifactorial, but insulin-resistant adipose tissue plays an important role. The natural history of NAFLD is incompletely understood, but risk factors for disease progression include weight gain, obesity and T2DM, as well as the severity of fibrosis stage at diagnosis. Diagnostic algorithms are evolving but we offer an approach that integrates for the non-hepatologist plasma biomarkers, imaging, and the role of liver biopsy for the management of these complex patients. At the present time, early screening -with biomarker panels or a liver ultrasound, ideally with transient elastography- is reserved for high-risk patients (i.e., obese patients with T2DM or elevated plasma AST/ALT levels or evidence of steatosis at a random liver exam) until more accurate non-invasive methods are available. A liver biopsy should be considered on a case-by-case basis, to identify those at risk of NASH-cirrhosis, working in close collaboration with a hepatologist. Treatment should include a comprehensive approach with lifestyle modification and therapeutic agents tested in RCTs, such as vitamin E (in patients without diabetes) or pioglitazone for patients with or without diabetes. Pioglitazone, given its low-cost as a generic medication, long-standing track record of efficacy in NASH, and cardiometabolic benefits, is likely to be for NASH what metformin has become for the management of T2DM. However, proper patient selection and close monitoring is needed. In addition, a number of new pharmacological agents are being studied in phase II/III trials and future management will involve the use of combination therapy, as for other chronic metabolic conditions. In summary, endocrinologists need to be aware of the severe metabolic and liver-specific complications of NASH and establish early-on a long-term management plan. Screening will likely take place in the same way as for diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy. A better understanding of its natural history and pathogenesis of NASH, combined with improved diagnostic and treatment options, will likely place endocrinologists at the forefront of the management efforts to prevent end-stage liver disease in patients with NASH.

1566	1566	232	Organic & biomolecular chemistry	The uncommon strong inhibition of α-glucosidase by multivalent glycoclusters based on cyclodextrin scaffolds.	The homeostasis disruption of d-glucose causes diabetes, a dramatic chronic disease worldwide. Type 1 diabetes is a successfully treatable form, where blood d-glucose is regulated by insulin treatment. In contrast type 2 diabetes, the non-insulin dependent kind, is problematic. The control of the d-glucose blood level via intestinal α-d-glucosidase inactivation can be achieved by using competitive inhibitors, such as iminosugars (e.g. acarbose) or sulfonium sugar derivatives (e.g. salacinol). Recently, an unprecedented result showed that multivalent diamond nanoparticles grafted with unmodified sugars displayed α-glucosidase inhibition at low micromolar concentrations. Herein we describe the synthesis of multivalent glycoclusters using cyclodextrins (CDs) as scaffolds and an assessment of their role as inhibitors of α-d-glucosidase. The glycoclusters were efficiently obtained from per-azido α, β and γ-CD derivatives and propargyl glycosides using click-chemistry under microwave irradiation. The methodology was successfully applied to various protected and non-protected propargylated monosaccharides, including both O- and S-glycosides, giving clear evidence of its versatility. The targeted 6-per-glycosylated CDs were isolated in moderate to excellent yields (30-90%) by silica gel chromatography. The results showed inhibition of α-glucosidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae with IC50 values in the 32-132 μM range, lower than that of acarbose (IC50 = ∼250 μM), a well-known competitive inhibitor used in the clinical treatment of type 2 diabetes. Preliminary experiments suggest a mixed-type non-competitive inhibition mode for these new glycoclusters.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31313800	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313800	diabetes	5445999759138709405

In the 1980s, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) criminalization laws became widespread across the United States. Today, such laws continue to be used to prosecute people living with HIV for a variety of behaviors though there is limited evidence that doing so curbs HIV transmission. HIV criminalization remains understudied, especially in the Deep South. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to trace the emergence, maintenance, and enforcement of HIV criminalization laws in South Carolina-a Southern state disproportionately burdened by HIV. Specifically, Nexis Uni and other criminology databases were used to identify HIV-related laws and criminal cases in South Carolina. Results indicate that the state's criminalization laws have remained nearly unchanged for over 30 years and continue to be used to prosecute individuals, a majority of whom are African-American. Findings support the need to reconsider HIV-related laws and devote more efforts to studying the impact of HIV criminalization on the Southern epidemic.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313094	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313094	HIV	-595851741330881198

Fifty patients who fulfilled the criteria were assessed. The mean age of presentation for both sexes were 36.44 year (SD=13.12 years). Morbid jealousy was found to be twice as common in males as compared in females. Highest prevalence was found among participants who had higher secondary education, belonged to middle socioeconomic status, and having psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia followed by depression. Delusional jealousy was the commonest followed by overvalued idea and obsession. A total of 20% of patients reported substance abuse like alcohol, cannabis, nicotine etc. either currently or in the past. Triggering factors found were spouse working away from home, interaction with opposite sex, attractiveness as perceived by the person with morbid jealousy. Females either as patients of morbid jealousy or as partners of a morbidly jealous spouse, carried the higher risk of suicide as compared to males.	2017	eng	Journal Article	India	31304242	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304242	depression	-6546787050052580484

1573	1573	425	Inflammopharmacology	Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor type 1 antagonist montelukast protects against injury of blood-brain barrier.	The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is formed by tightly connected cerebrovascular endothelial cells. Injury of human brain endothelial cells can cause disruption of the BBB and severe injury to brain tissue. Signals mediated cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) and their receptors are involved in a variety of pathological conditions. In the current study, our results show that oxygen glucose-deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) induced the expression of leukotriene receptor type 1 (cysLT1R) in brain endothelial cells. Blockage of cysLT1R by its specific antagonist montelukast suppressed OGD/R-induced altered permeability of the human brain endothelial cell (EC) monolayer. Mechanistically, montelukast treatment reversed OGD/R-induced reduction of the tight junction proteins occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Montelukast also ameliorated OGD/R-induced reduction of inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs), such as TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. On the other hand, montelukast suppressed the expression and production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cytokines including MMP-2, MMP-9, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Using a murine middle cerebral artery occlusion brain injury model, we demonstrated that the administration of montelukast improved the surgery-induced brain injury and protected against disruption of brain endothelial junction proteins such as occludin and ZO-1. Collectively, our data suggest that montelukast might confer protective roles against injury in brain endothelial cells.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31313075	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313075	stroke	-3404981437157985820

An important requirement to decrease the side effects of chemotherapy drugs is to develop nanocarriers with precise biological functions. In this work, a set of glyconanoparticles was prepared via self-assembly of amphiphilic glycoblock copolymers for the targeted delivery of a hydrophobic chemotherapy drug. Well-defined glycoblock copolymers that consist of 1,1-di-tert-butyl 3-(2-(metyloyloxy)ethyl)-butane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate (MAETC) together with three different protected-sugar moieties (β-D-glucopyranoside, β-D-mannopyranoside, and β-L-fucopyranoside) were synthesized by using RAFT polymerization. Copolymers were deprotected and conjugated with the cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum (II) (cis-Pt) anticancer drug. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements revealed that cis-Pt conjugated glyconanoparticles were sufficiently stable under physiological conditions and had diameters of approximately 100 nm with considerably narrow size distributions. They were intracellularly taken up by the breast cancer (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), prostate cancer (PC3), renal cancer (769-P) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. PC3 and 769-P cell lines showed a high preference for the glycosylated nanoparticles. Glycoblock copolymers were found nontoxic, but showed high cytotoxicity and increased efficacy after conjugation with cis-Pt anticancer drug. Moreover, in vitro cytotoxicity assays in cancer cell lines demonstrate that cis-Pt loaded glycopolymer-based nanoparticles have a higher cytotoxicity than free cis-Pt. Overall, our results suggest that glyconanoparticles have a great potential to be used as an effective cis-Pt drug carrier for targeted cancer therapy.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31314508	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314508	cancer	1158279435862414346

Better control of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks requires deeper understanding of within-flock virus transmission dynamics. For such fatal diseases, daily mortality provides a proxy for disease incidence. We used the daily mortality data collected during the 2015 H5N2 HPAI outbreak in Minnesota turkey flocks to estimate the within-flock transmission rate parameter (β). The number of birds in Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Recovered compartments was inferred from the data and used in a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) to estimate the parameters. Novel here was the correction of these data for normal mortality before use in the fitting process. We also used mortality threshold to determine HPAI-like mortality to improve the accuracy of estimates from the back-calculation approach. The estimated β was 3.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-4.3) per day with a basic reproduction number of 12.8 (95% CI 9.2-17.2). Although flock-level estimates varied, the overall estimate was comparable to those from other studies. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the estimated β was highly sensitive to the bird-level latent period, emphasizing the need for its precise estimation. In all, for fatal poultry diseases, the back-calculation approach provides a computationally efficient means to obtain reasonable transmission parameter estimates from mortality data.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31063119	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063119	flu	2436112252908442663

Lower respiratory infection caused by human pathogens such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant healthcare burden that must be addressed. The preferred options to achieve this goal are usually to develop vaccines for prophylaxis and to develop antiviral small molecules to treat infected patients with convenient, orally administrable drugs. However, developing a vaccine against RSV poses special challenges with the diminished immune system of infants and the elderly, and finding a universal flu vaccine is difficult because the product must target a large array of viral strains. On the other hand, the use of small-molecule antivirals can result in the emergence of resistant viruses as it has well-been reported for HIV, influenza, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). This paper reviews peptide antiviral strategies as an alternative to address these challenges. The discovery of influenza and RSV peptidic fusion inhibitors will be discussed and compared to small molecules in view of escape mutations. The importance of constraining peptides into macrocycles to improve both their inhibitory activity and pharmacological properties will be highlighted.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31293570	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293570	flu	-9190737901804729417

The SMST can be considered an effective self-rating test to assess self-management competence in individuals from the general population as well as in people with major depression. It may also be useful to detect treatment outcomes in people with major depression. The high internal consistency indicates that all 5 items are important for the test as a whole. The low test-retest reliability suggests sensitivity to change. The SMST is likely to differentiate particularly well at low levels of self-management competence, suggesting it may be a useful tool in studies investigating people with depression or other psychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder.

EsxA is an essential virulence factor for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) pathogenesis as well as an important biomarker for Mtb detection. In this study, we use light microscopy and deep learning-based image analysis to classify the morphologic changes of macrophages infected by Mycobacterium marinum (Mm), a surrogate model for Mtb. Macrophages were infected either with the mCherry-expressing Mm wild type strain (Mm(WT)), or a mutant strain with deletion of the esxA-esxB operon (Mm(ΔEsxA:B)). The mCherry serves as an infection marker to train the convolution neural network (CNN) and to validate the classification results. Data show that CNN can distinguish the Mm(WT)-infected cells from uninfected cells with an accuracy of 92.4% at 2 hours postinfection (hpi). However, the accuracy at 12 and 24 hpi is decreased to ∼75% and ∼83%, respectively, suggesting dynamic morphologic changes through different stages of infection. The accuracy of discriminating Mm(ΔEsxA:B)-infected cells from uninfected cells is lower than 80% at all time, which is consistent to attenuated virulence of Mm(ΔEsxA:B). Interestingly, CNN distinguishes Mm(WT)-infected cells from Mm(ΔEsxA:B)-infected cells with ∼90% accuracy, implicating EsxA induces unique morphologic changes in macrophages. Deconvolutional analysis successfully reconstructed the morphologic features used by CNN for classification, which are indistinguishable to naked eyes and distinct from intracellular mycobacteria. This study presents a deep learning-aided imaging analytical tool that can accurately detect virulent mycobacteria-infected macrophages by cellular morphologic changes. The observed morphologic changes induced by EsxA warrant further studies to fill the gap from molecular actions of bacterial virulence factors to cellular morphology.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31287998	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287998	tuberculosis	-5000193502203199335

The oral triiodothyronine for infants and children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (OTICC) trial showed that Triiodothyronine (T3) supplementation improved hemodynamic and clinical outcome parameters. We tested the validity of low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), derived using clinical parameters and laboratory data, by comparing the LCOS diagnosis with objective parameters commonly measured in a cardiac intensive care unit (CCU) setting. OTICC, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial included children younger than 3 years with an Aristotle score between 6 and 9. We used the existing trial data set to compare the LCOS diagnosis with echocardiographic hemodynamic parameters. Additionally, we determined if LCOS, prospectively assigned during a clinical trial, served as an early predictor of clinical outcomes. All LCOS subjects at 6 and 12 h after cross-clamp release later showed significantly lower pulse pressure, stroke volume and cardiac output, and higher systemic vascular resistance. These LCOS patients also had significantly longer time to extubation (TTE) and higher mortality rate. LCOS incidence was significantly lower in the T3 treatment group [n = 86 vs. 66, respectively, p < 0.001; OR (95% CI) 0.43 (0.36-0.52)] particularly at 6 h. Also, LCOS patients in the placebo group had significantly lower FT3 serum levels over time. These analyses confirm that early clinically defined LCOS successfully predicts cardiac dysfunction determined later by objective hemodynamic echocardiographic parameters. Furthermore, early LCOS significantly impacts TTE and mortality. Finally, the data support prior clinical trial data, showing that oral T3 supplementation decreases early LCOS in concordance with reducing TTE.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31309235	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309235	heart+disease	6614704926858202954

The interaction between a low pathogenic avian influenza virus (A/CK/TUN/145/2012), a H9N2 Tunisian isolate, and a vaccine strain (H120) of avian infectious bronchitis, administered simultaneously or sequentially three days apart to chicks during 20 days, was evaluated using ELISA antibody levels, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses and histopathology examination. First, the in vivo replication interference of avian influenza virus (AIV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was evaluated using qRT-PCR to detect accurately either AIV or IBV genomes or viral copy numbers during dual infections. Second, we have determined the amount of specific antibodies in sera of chick's infected with AIV alone, IBV alone, mixed AIV + IBV, IBV then AIV or AIV IBV 3 days later using an ELISA test. Finally, histopathological analyses of internal organs from inoculated chicks were realized. Quantitative results of AIV and IBV co-infection showed that interferences between the two viruses yielded decreased viral growth. However, in the case of super-infection, the second virus, either AIV or IBV, induced a decrease in the growth of the first inoculated virus. According to our results, vaccine application was safe and do not interfere with AIV H9N2 infection, and does not enhance such infection. In conclusion, co-infection of chicks with AIV and IBV, simultaneously or sequentially, affected the clinical signs, the virus replication dynamics as well as the internal organ integrity. The results proposed that infection with heterologous virus may result in temporary competition for cell receptors or competent cells for replication, most likely interferon-mediated.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31300117	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300117	vaccine	2822049545552366036

Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) associated with malignancy is rare; its infrequency and similarity to other diagnoses make it a significant diagnostic challenge. A 63-year-old woman on rivaroxaban for prior deep vein thrombosis presented with left upper extremity weakness and left facial droop with imaging demonstrating multiple strokes. Echocardiograms revealed mitral and aortic valve vegetations. The patient was switched to apixaban and started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for presumed culture-negative endocarditis. Despite continuing apixaban, her hospital course was complicated by new acute embolic infarcts. Workup confirmed non-mucinous metastatic biliary adenocarcinoma. The patient was placed on a heparin drip then switched to low molecular weight heparin without further embolic events and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility in stable condition with plans for chemotherapy as an outpatient.

Asthma is a chronic, complex and heterogeneous inflammatory illness, characterized by obstruction of the lower airways. About 334 million people worldwide suffer from asthma, and these estimates, as well as the severity of the disease, have increased in the last decades. Glucocorticoids are currently the most widely used drugs in the treatment and control of asthma symptoms, but their prolonged use can cause serious adverse effects. N-acylhydrazone derivatives have been tested in pre-clinical studies in models of inflammatory diseases. Here we tested SintMed65 (N'-[(1E)-3-(4-nitrophenylhydrazono)]-(2E)-propan-2-ylidene-3,5-dinitrobenzohydrazide), a compound belonging to a novel class of immunosuppressive drugs, in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation. BALB/c mice were sensitized previously and challenged with ovalbumin for five consecutive days and SintMed65 treatment was performed orally 1 h prior to challenge with ovalbumin. Administration of SintMed65, as well as the reference drug dexamethasone, reduced cellularity and the number of eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF). SintMed65 also reduced the production of Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 in the BALF, and IL-4, IL-10 and CCL8 gene expression in lung, compared to vehicle-treated mice. Importantly, a reduction in the number of leukocytes and in the mucus production in lungs of SintMed65-treated mice was found, compared to the vehicle-treated group. In contrast, IgE production was not significantly altered after treatment with SintMed65. Our results demonstrate that compound SintMed65 possesses anti-inflammatory characteristics, suggesting its therapeutic potential for the treatment of allergic diseases.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31306982	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306982	asthma	-2141497471886086313

1617	1617	287	Gut microbes	Gut microbiota composition explains more variance in the host cardiometabolic risk than genetic ancestry.	Cardiometabolic affections greatly contribute to the global burden of disease. The susceptibility to obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes, conditions that add to the cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS), was associated with the ancestral genetic composition and gut microbiota. Studies explicitly testing associations between genetic ancestry and gut microbes are growing. We here examined whether the host genetic ancestry was associated with gut microbiota composition, and distinguished the effects of genetic ancestry and non-genetic factors on human cardiometabolic health. We performed a cross-sectional study with 441 community-dwelling Colombian mestizos from five cities spanning the Andes, Pacific, and Caribbean coasts. We characterized the host genetic ancestry by genotyping 40 ancestry informative markers; characterized gut microbiota through 16S rRNA gene sequencing; assessed diet intake, physical activity, cigarette, and medicament consumption; and measured cardiometabolic outcomes that allowed calculating a CMS risk scale. On average, each individual of our cohort was 67 ± 6% European, 21 ± 5% Native American and 12 ± 5% African. Multivariable-adjusted generalized linear models showed that individuals with higher Native American and African ancestries had increased fasting insulin, body mass index and CMS risk, as assessed by the CMS risk scale. Furthermore, we identified 21 OTUs associated to the host genetic ancestry and 20 to cardiometabolic health. While we highlight novel associations between genetic ancestry and gut microbiota, we found that the effect of intestinal microbes was more likely to explain the variance in CMS risk scale than the contributions of European, Native American and African genetic backgrounds.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31311405	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311405	diabetes	-8239286201029609369

Control of Streptococcus pneumoniae colonisation at human mucosal surfaces is critical to reducing the burden of pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease, interrupting transmission, and achieving herd protection. Here, we use an experimental human pneumococcal carriage model (EHPC) to show that S. pneumoniae colonisation is associated with epithelial surface adherence, micro-colony formation and invasion, without overt disease. Interactions between different strains and the epithelium shaped the host transcriptomic response in vitro. Using epithelial modules from a human epithelial cell model that recapitulates our in vivo findings, comprising of innate signalling and regulatory pathways, inflammatory mediators, cellular metabolism and stress response genes, we find that inflammation in the EHPC model is most prominent around the time of bacterial clearance. Our results indicate that, rather than being confined to the epithelial surface and the overlying mucus layer, the pneumococcus undergoes micro-invasion of the epithelium that enhances inflammatory and innate immune responses associated with clearance.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31311921	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311921	stress	-133139342397538859

1621	1621	342	PLoS genetics	A gene co-expression network-based analysis of multiple brain tissues reveals novel genes and molecular pathways underlying major depression.	Major depression is a common and severe psychiatric disorder with a highly polygenic genetic architecture. Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified multiple independent genetic loci that harbour variants associated with major depression, but the exact causal genes and biological mechanisms are largely unknown. Tissue-specific network approaches may identify molecular mechanisms underlying major depression and provide a biological substrate for integrative analyses. We provide a framework for the identification of individual risk genes and gene co-expression networks using genome-wide association summary statistics and gene expression information across multiple human brain tissues and whole blood. We developed a novel gene-based method called eMAGMA that leverages tissue-specific eQTL information to identify 99 biologically plausible risk genes associated with major depression, of which 58 are novel. Among these novel associations is Complement Factor 4A (C4A), recently implicated in schizophrenia through its role in synaptic pruning during postnatal development. Major depression risk genes were enriched in gene co-expression modules in multiple brain tissues and the implicated gene modules contained genes involved in synaptic signalling, neuronal development, and cell transport pathways. Modules enriched with major depression signals were strongly preserved across brain tissues, but were weakly preserved in whole blood, highlighting the importance of using disease-relevant tissues in genetic studies of psychiatric traits. We identified tissue-specific genes and gene co-expression networks associated with major depression. Our novel analytical framework can be used to gain fundamental insights into the functioning of the nervous system in major depression and other brain-related traits.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31306407	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306407	depression	-6651333707067617642

While immediate percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) continues to be the mainline treatment strategy, mortality remains as high as 40% before hospital discharge. Even after hospital discharge, survivors of cardiogenic shock complicating myocardial infarction (CSMI) often suffer from severe heart failure and its consequences, including repeated hospitalization and high mortality. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices during CSMI PCI can be lifesaving by supporting poor ventricular function while decreasing myocardial wall stress and relieving ischemia. In this chapter, we review the definition and pathophysiology of CSMI, the major ventricular support devices, an algorithm for MCS use in STEMI, relevant data, and a prototypic case that illustrates CSMI management augmented by MCS.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314421	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314421	stress	-4921088466135297415

Peritoneal tuberculosis (PTB), although rarer than its pulmonary counterpart, is a serious health concern in regions of the world with high tuberculosis prevalence. Individuals with baseline immunocompromise condition, whether acquired or medically induced, are at greatest risk for experiencing PTB. While medical treatment of the condition is similar to that of the pulmonary disease, the generally immunocompromised state of those infected with PTB, along with a lack of highly sensitive and specific testing methods make early diagnosis difficult. This review discusses the risks factors, clinical features, diagnostic methods, and treatment options for PTB.	2019	eng	Review	China	31293914	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293914	tuberculosis	1403599387299754918

Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the deadliest infectious diseases in humankind history. Although, drug sensible TB is slowly decreasing, at present the rise of TB cases produced by multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant strains is a big challenge. Thus, looking for new therapeutic options against these MDR strains is mandatory. In the present work, we studied, in BALB/c mice infected with MDR strain, the therapeutic effect of supra-pharmacological doses of the conventional primary antibiotics rifampicin and isoniazid (administrated by gavage or intratracheal routes), in combination with recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). This high dose of antibiotics administered for 3 months, overcome the resistant threshold of the MDR strain producing a significant reduction of pulmonary bacillary loads but induced liver damage, which was totally prevented by the administration of HGF. To address the long-term efficiency of this combined treatment, groups of animals after 1 month of treatment termination were immunosuppressed by glucocorticoid administration and, after 1 month, mice were euthanized, and the bacillary load was determined in lungs. In comparison with animals treated only with a high dose of antibiotics, animals that received the combined treatment showed significantly lower bacterial burdens. Thus, treatment of MDR-TB with very high doses of primary antibiotics particularly administrated by aerial route can produce a very good therapeutic effect, and its hepatic toxicity can be prevented by the administration of HGF, becoming in a new treatment modality for MDR-TB.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31283037	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31283037	tuberculosis	4807410384082534048

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus (FT1DM) in Chinese patients and to further determine their glycaemic profiles through continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Thirty subjects who were diagnosed with FT1DM according to the 2012 JDS criteria were enrolled. Clinical characteristics were compared to those reported in Japanese FT1DM. All subjects received retrospective CGM for 3 days after being converted to subcutaneous insulin injection therapy. Chinese FT1DM patients presented with a shorter duration of symptoms (2.84 ± 2.42 days vs 4.4 ± 3.1 days, P < 0.01), worse islet function (fasting C-peptide, 0.09 ± 0.11 ng/mL vs 0.30 ± 0.21 ng/mL; 2-hour C-peptide, 0.13 ± 0.14 ng/mL vs 0.30 ± 0.30 ng/mL, both P < 0.01), lower prevalence of flu-like symptoms (46.7% vs 71.4%, P < 0.05), and a significantly higher GADA positive rate (23.3% vs 5.1%, P < 0.01) when compared with Japanese patients. The CGM results showed that the mean time in range (TIR) of FT1DM patients was 49.8 ± 22.1%, while mean amplitude of glycaemic excursion (MAGE) and standard deviations of sensor glucose (SDSG) were 7.58 ± 3.59 mmol/L and 3.19 ± 1.22 mmol/L, respectively, with nearly 1/3 participants coefficient of variation (CV) > 36% (all are male), suggesting a large glucose fluctuation. The female patients were further divided into pregnancy-related FT1DM (PF) and non-PF (NPF) subgroups (both n = 5), and we found that PF patients had a significantly higher TIR than NPF patients (77.0 ± 16.1% vs 41.0 ± 22.4%, P < 0.05). There were heterogeneities in the clinical characteristics of FT1DM patients, and the CGM results indicated a very low TIR and large glucose fluctuation which needs careful attention.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Australia	31050819	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31050819	flu	30461094217357731

Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) associated with malignancy is rare; its infrequency and similarity to other diagnoses make it a significant diagnostic challenge. A 63-year-old woman on rivaroxaban for prior deep vein thrombosis presented with left upper extremity weakness and left facial droop with imaging demonstrating multiple strokes. Echocardiograms revealed mitral and aortic valve vegetations. The patient was switched to apixaban and started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for presumed culture-negative endocarditis. Despite continuing apixaban, her hospital course was complicated by new acute embolic infarcts. Workup confirmed non-mucinous metastatic biliary adenocarcinoma. The patient was placed on a heparin drip then switched to low molecular weight heparin without further embolic events and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility in stable condition with plans for chemotherapy as an outpatient. These clinical, imaging, and histologic findings were consistent with a rare case of NBTE associated with primary non-mucinous gallbladder malignancy complicated by recurrent strokes in which direct oral anticoagulants did not provide adequate anticoagulation.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313109	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313109	cancer	2203293143157288172

1643	1643	607	 	 	This open access handbook synthesizes and analyzes the growing knowledge base on life course health development (LCHD) from the prenatal period through emerging adulthood, with implications for clinical practice and public health. It presents LCHD as an innovative field with a sound theoretical framework for understanding wellness and disease from a lifespan perspective, replacing previous medical, biopsychosocial, and early genomic models of health. Interdisciplinary chapters discuss major health concerns (diabetes, obesity), important less-studied conditions (hearing, kidney health), and large-scale issues (nutrition, adversity) from a lifespan viewpoint. In addition, chapters address methodological approaches and challenges by analyzing existing measures, studies, and surveys. The book concludes with the editors’ research agenda that proposes priorities for future LCHD research and its application to health care practice and health policy. Topics featured in the Handbook include: The prenatal period and its effect on child obesity and metabolic outcomes. Pregnancy complications and their effect on women’s cardiovascular health. A multi-level approach for obesity prevention in children. Application of the LCHD framework to autism spectrum disorder. Socioeconomic disadvantage and its influence on health development across the lifespan. The importance of nutrition to optimal health development across the lifespan. The Handbook of Life Course Health Development is a must-have resource for researchers, clinicians/professionals, and graduate students in developmental psychology/science; maternal and child health; social work; health economics; educational policy and politics; and medical law as well as many interrelated subdisciplines in psychology, medicine, public health, mental health, education, social welfare, economics, sociology, and law.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314220	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314220	obesity	-4541461982704074404

This review identified 21 studies of psychological interventions for the management of migraine. We did not find evidence that psychological interventions affected migraine frequency, a result based on four studies of primarily brief treatments. Those who received psychological interventions were twice as likely to be classified as responders in the short term, but this was based on very low-quality evidence and there was no evidence of an effect of psychological intervention compared to control at follow-up. There was no evidence of an effect of psychological interventions on medication usage, mood, migraine-related disability or quality of life. There was no evidence of an effect of psychological interventions on migraine frequency in the short-term or long-term. In terms of adverse events, we were unable to draw conclusions as there was insufficient evidence. High and unclear risk of bias in study design and reporting, small numbers of participants, performance and detection bias meant that we rated all evidence as very low quality. Therefore, we conclude that there is an absence of high-quality evidence to determine whether psychological interventions are effective in managing migraine in adults and we are uncertain whether there is any difference between psychological therapies and controls.	2019	eng	Review	England	31264211	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31264211	headache	358192030955601318

Neuropathological features in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are amyloid β (Aβ) deposits and neurofibrillary changes. AD is characterized by memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction, with some reports associating these impairments with hyperexcitability caused by Aβ in the medial temporal lobe. Epileptic seizures are known to be common in AD. We encountered a 65-year-old patient with cavernous malformation (CM) in the right temporal lobe who exhibited epileptic amnesia (EA) and AD-like symptoms. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG), including long-term video-EEG, showed no interictal discharges, but intraoperative subdural electrode (SE) recording from the right parahippocampal area showed frequent epileptiform discharges. Neuropathologically, senile plaques were found in the surrounding normal cortex of the CM. Postoperatively, the patient has remained free of EA and AD-like symptoms since total removal of the CM. This is the first surgical case report to confirm temporal lobe hyperexcitability associated with EA and AD-like symptoms.	2019	eng	Case Reports	Switzerland	31249550	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31249550	Alzheimer	-8854146354650101086

Visual impairment is common in people living with dementia and regular ophthalmological exams may improve their quality of life. We evaluated visual function in a cohort of elderly individuals and analyzed its association with their degree of cognitive impairment. Participants underwent neurological and neuropsychological exams, neuro-ophthalmological assessment (visual acuity, intraocular pressure, rates of past ophthalmological pathologies, use of ocular correction, treatments and surgeries) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan. We analyzed differences in ophthalmological characteristics among diagnostic groups. The final sample of 1746 study participants aged ≥ 50 comprised 229 individuals with Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD), 695 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 833 with Dementia (Alzheimer disease: n = 660; vascular dementia: n = 92, Lewy body dementia: n = 34; frontotemporal dementia: n = 19 and other: n = 28). Age, gender and education were used as covariates. Patients with Dementia, compared to those with SCD and MCI, presented worse visual acuity (p < 0.001), used less visual correction (p = 0.02 and p < 0.001, respectively) and fewer ophthalmological treatments (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively) and underwent fewer ocular surgeries (p = 0.009 and p < 0.001, respectively). OCT image quality worsened in parallel to cognitive decline (Dementia vs SCD: p = 0.008; Dementia vs MCI: p < 0.001). No group differences in past ophthalmological disorders or abnormal OCT findings were detected. Efforts should be made to ensure dementia patients undergo regular ophthalmological assessments to correct their visual function in order to improve their quality of life.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31213626	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31213626	Alzheimer	-2377881752614744441

HLA-I associated HIV adaptation is known to negatively impact disease progression and CD8 T-cell responses. We aimed to assess how HLA-I associated adaptation impacts HIV vaccine-induced CD8 T-cell responses in two past vaccine efficacy trials. We found that vaccine-encoded adapted epitopes were less immunogenic than vaccine-encoded non-adapted epitopes, and adapted epitope-specific responses were less polyfunctional than non-adapted epitope-specific responses. Along those lines, vaccine recipients with higher HLA-I adaptation to the Gag vaccine insert mounted less polyfunctional CD8 T-cell responses at the protein-level. Response breadth, which correlated with viral control in recipients who became infected, is also dampened by HLA-I adaptation. These findings suggest that HLA-I associated adaptation is an important consideration for strategies aiming to induce robust CD8 T-cell responses.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31301135	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301135	HIV	3301147467076954944

The samples collected from the source of drinking water also showed the presence of the only RVB. Absence of other viral agents and identification of RVB of genotype G2 as the etiological agent of the acute gastroenteritis outbreak highlights, the necessity of monitoring RVB, the viral agent known for its large outbreak potential.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31276221	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31276221	Diarrhea	5447580952505296338

Mental disorders have a multifactorial etiology and stress presents as one of the causal factors. In depression, it is suggested that high cortisol concentration contributes directly to the pathology of this disease. Based on that, the study aims to evaluate the potential antidepressant effect of Riparin IV (Rip IV) in mice submitted to chronic stress model by repeated corticosterone administration. Female Swiss mice were selected into four groups: control (Ctrl), corticosterone (Cort), Riparin IV (Cort + Rip IV) and fluvoxamine (Cort + Flu). Three groups were administrated subcutaneously (SC) with corticosterone (20 mg/kg) during twenty-one days, while the control group received only vehicle. After the fourteenth day, groups were administrated tested drugs: Riparin IV, fluvoxamine or distilled water, by gavage, 1 h after subcutaneous injections. After the final treatment, animals were exposed to behavioral models such as forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze (EPM) and sucrose preference test (SPT). The hippocampus was also removed for the determination of BDNF levels. Corticosterone treatment altered all parameters in behavioral tests, leading to a depressive- and anxious-like behavior. Riparin IV and fluvoxamine exhibit antidepressant effect in FST, TST and SPT. In EPM and OFT, treatment displayed anxiolytic effect without alteration of locomotor activity. Corticosterone administration decreased BDNF levels and Riparin IV could reestablish them, indicating that its antidepressant effect may be related to ability to ameliorate hippocampal neurogenesis. These findings suggest that Riparin IV improves the depressive and anxious symptoms after chronic stress and could be a new alternative treatment for patients with depression.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	30904544	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30904544	flu	5227822864949117283
1663	1663	649	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society	β-Amyloid Aggregation and Heterogeneous Nucleation.	In this article, we consider the role of heterogeneous nucleation in β-amyloid aggregation. Heterogeneous nucleation is more common, and occurs at lower levels of supersaturation than homogeneous nucleation. The nucleation period is also the stage at which most of the polymorphism of amyloids arises, this being one of the defining features of amyloids. We focus on several well-known heterogeneous nucleators of β-amyloid, including lipid surfaces, especially those enriched in gangliosides and cholesterol, and divalent metal ions. These two broad classes of nucleators affect β-amyloid particularly in light of the amphiphilicity of these peptides: the N-terminal region, which is largely polar and charged, contains the metal binding site, while the C-terminal region is aliphatic and is important in lipid binding. Notably, these two classes of nucleators can interact cooperatively, aggregation begetting greater aggregation. This article is protected by copyright.

Eczema is increasing worldwide with associated increases in health costs and decreases in quality of life. There are many factors that are speculated to interact in the development of eczema including genetics and environmental exposures. Prevention of the development of eczema may prevent the further development of food allergies and asthma. This concept has prompted a variety of research into the area of primary prevention of eczema in infants. This exploration includes a growing body of research examining infants supplemented with probiotics, prebiotics, or both (synbiotics) often compared with their breastfed counterparts. The goal of this paper is to examine the evidence for manipulating the microbiome in the prevention of eczema. Several strains of probiotics, compositions of prebiotics, and varied combinations of both are commercially available. Evidence supports altering the microbiome in infants at high risk of atopy who are not able to breastfeed with Lactobacillus strains when given both prenatally followed by prolonged use (greater than 6 months) postnatally for the primary prevention of eczema. Prebiotics have also been shown beneficial for primary prevention of eczema in formula-fed infants with prolonged use greater than 6 months. These findings are in keeping with the World Allergy Organization (WAO) recommendations that support interventions to manipulate the microbiome with both probiotics and prebiotics.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31309394	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309394	asthma	7004101889471761341
1669	1669	27	Cureus	A Case Report: Tragic Death in a Young Patient with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Due to Cryptococcal Meningitis.	Cryptococcal meningitis is a systemic infection that can be seen in immunosuppressed patients. Altered mental status, somnolence, and obtundation are warning signs of poor prognosis or advanced disease processes. We present a 23-year-old female with a past medical history significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) obtained via vertical transmission who presented to the emergency department (ED) with a gradual onset of worsening headache over 10 days, with blurry vision, photophobia, nausea and vomiting, and progressive memory lapses. Her blood tests, chest plain radiograph, and non-contrast brain computed tomography (CT) were normal. In the ED, she developed a fever of 102°F and became more confused and agitated, with interspersed screaming and yelling. A lumbar puncture (LP) showed elevated white blood cell count and was positive for Cryptococcus neoformans; an opening pressure was unable to be obtained due to patient agitation. Despite prompt intravenous antibiotics and antifungal medications, her short, but tenuous hospital course involved declining mental status, requiring intubation and multiple therapeutic lumbar punctures, with an elevated opening pressure of up to 55 cm H2O. The patient suffered global ischemic encephalopathy and died on hospital day two. This case highlights the rapid decompensation of a young immunocompromised patient with cryptococcal meningitis, as well as the importance of early disease management and consultation to neurology and neurosurgery services. An important paradigm difference for emergency medicine (EM) physicians in the management of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with cryptococcal meningitis is avoiding acetazolamide, mannitol, and steroids and considering the indication for neurosurgical interventions for severe cryptococcal meningitis.	2019	eng	Case Reports	United States	31312577	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312577	HIV	-8460222552900599049

Typhoid fever is endemic across sub-Saharan Africa. However, estimates of the burden of typhoid are undermined by insufficient blood volumes and lack of sensitivity of blood culture. Here, we aimed to address this limitation by exploiting pre-enrichment culture followed by PCR, alongside routine blood culture to improve typhoid case detection. We carried out a prospective diagnostic cohort study and enrolled children (aged 0-4 years) with non-specific febrile disease admitted to a tertiary hospital in Blantyre, Malawi from August 2014 to July 2016. Blood was collected for culture (BC) and real-time PCR after a pre-enrichment culture in tryptone soy broth and ox-bile. DNA was subjected to PCR for invA (Pan-Salmonella), staG (S. Typhi), and fliC (S. Typhimurium) genes. A positive PCR was defined as invA plus either staG or fliC (CT<29). IgM and IgG ELISA against four S. Typhi antigens was also performed. In total, 643 children (median age 1.3 years) with nonspecific febrile disease were enrolled; 31 (4.8%) were BC positive for Salmonella (n = 13 S. Typhi, n = 16 S. Typhimurium, and n = 2 S. Enteritidis). Pre-enrichment culture of blood followed by PCR identified a further 8 S. Typhi and 15 S. Typhimurium positive children. IgM and IgG titres to the S. Typhi antigen STY1498 (haemolysin) were significantly higher in children that were PCR positive but blood culture negative compared to febrile children with all other non-typhoid illnesses. The addition of pre-enrichment culture and PCR increased the case ascertainment of invasive Salmonella disease in children by 62-94%. These data support recent burden estimates that highlight the insensitivity of blood cultures and support the targeting of pre-school children for typhoid vaccine prevention in Africa. Blood culture with real-time PCR following pre-enrichment should be used to further refine estimates of vaccine effectiveness in typhoid vaccine trials.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31314752	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314752	vaccine	-3102446808559723934

"This study sought to perform a systematic review of adverse events reported with the use of cabergoline for postpartum lactation inhibition or suppression in women aged 15 to 50. Following registration with PROSPERO (CRD42017049894), a comprehensive search of the Ovid databases Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL, along with PubMed, was conducted from January 1, 1985 to January 25, 2018. All study designs investigating cabergoline use for postpartum lactation inhibition or suppression in women aged 15 to 50 were included. A total of 695 articles were retrieved, and 25 articles were eligible for inclusion. Adverse events were then reported in terms of frequency, with percentages calculated according to the total number of women exposed to the intervention. A bias assessment of the articles was also performed. Among a total of 757 women, 108 adverse events were observed in 96 women (14.2%). The most common adverse events were dizziness (35 of 757), headache (30 of 757), and nausea or vomiting (19 of 757). These events were described as short-lived, self-resolving, and dose dependent. One pharmacovigilance study reported 29 ""serious"" events from a total of 175 events in 72 case reports, which included thromboembolic and neurologic events. Four case studies specifically addressed the psychiatric population, with one half reporting psychiatric symptoms following administration of cabergoline. In conclusion, this systematic review demonstrates that adverse events were generally benign and tolerable following the administration of cabergoline. However, pharmacovigilance data reveal that vigilance is still needed given the occurrence of rare but serious events."	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31285168	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285168	headache	-6875247493073242590

This article examines the role of Black American nurses during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic and the aftermath of World War I. The pandemic caused at least 50 million deaths worldwide and 675 000 in the United States. It occurred during a period of pervasive segregation and racial violence, in which Black Americans were routinely denied access to health, educational, and political institutions. We discuss how an unsuccessful campaign by Black leaders for admission of Black nurses to the Red Cross, the Army Nurse Corps, and the Navy Nurse Corps during World War I eventually created opportunities for 18 Black nurses to serve in the army during the pandemic and the war's aftermath. Analyzing archival sources, news reports, and published materials, we examine these events in the context of nursing and early civil rights history. This analysis demonstrates that the pandemic incrementally advanced civil rights in the Army Nurse Corps and Red Cross, while providing ephemeral opportunities for Black nurses overall. This case study reframes the response to epidemics and other public health emergencies as potential opportunities to advance health equity.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	30998410	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30998410	flu	3884256359744615997

Background Because family history is a known risk factor for heart disease, it is important to characterize its public health impact in terms of population prevalence of family history of heart disease, the burden of heart disease attributable to family history, and whether family history interacts with modifiable risk factors for heart disease. Methods and Results We used population data from NHANES (the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [2007-2014]) to measure the association of self-reported family history of premature heart disease ( FHPHD ) with cardiovascular disease (n=19 253) and to examine the association between cardiovascular health metrics and FHPHD (n=16 248). Using logistic regression and multivariable adjustment, family history odds ratios were 5.91 (95% CI , 3.34-10.44) for ages 20 to 39, 3.02 (95% CI, 2.41-3.79) for ages 40 to 59, and 1.87 (95% CI , 1.54-2.28) for age ≥60 for cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease for the population with a FHPHD (15.72%; 95% CI , 13.81-17.64) was more than double the prevalence of cardiovascular disease for those without a family history (6.25%; 95% CI , 5.82-6.69). Compared with participants with optimum cardiovascular health, the prevalence ratio for FHPHD was 1.98 (95% CI , 1.40-2.79) for those with inadequate cardiovascular health. Conclusions Millions of people who are at high risk of having cardiovascular disease could be identified using FHPHD . FHPHD can become an important component of public health campaigns that address modifiable risk factors that plan to reduce the overall risk of heart disease.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31303097	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303097	heart+disease	-5039153034159656707

Unused/expired pharmaceuticals are disposed of to the municipal sewage system or waste disposal. Consequently, many countries have implemented a system of collecting pharmaceutical waste, with pharmacies playing an important role. It is important to educate consumers on rational consumption and the appropriate disposal of unused/expired pharmaceuticals and to identify the level of public awareness. Two studies were conducted in Poland to estimate the problem of collection and disposal of expired/unused pharmaceuticals. The purpose of the Survey I was to identify the scale of pharmaceutical consumption and the way pharmaceuticals are disposed of by various social groups. The Survey II was aimed to identify patients' attitudes regarding expired/unused pharmaceuticals at home. Of the respondents who participated in in Survey I, almost 74% indicated that analgesics were among the over-the-counter drugs they purchased. Group of pharmaceuticals 65% of the respondents purchased were medicines for treating flu symptoms. Almost 68% of the respondents said they usually disposed of expired pharmaceuticals in their household waste or by flushing them down the toilet. In Survey II more than 35% reported that they disposed of pharmaceuticals in the same ways. Of all respondents, ~30% returned their expired pharmaceuticals to pharmacies. Most respondents (over 65%) who participated Survey I indicated that they were aware that pharmaceutical waste can be returned to pharmacies. It should be noted that local governments are currently not obliged by law to work with or compensate pharmacies in the collection and proper disposal of unused pharmaceuticals.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31076828	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076828	flu	4375556914674736641

1697	1697	16	Immunology	Genetic Reprogramming For NK cell Cancer Immunotherapy with CRISPR/Cas9.	Natural killer cells are potent cytotoxic lymphocytes specialized in recognizing and eliminating transformed cells, and in orchestrating adaptive anti-tumour immunity. However, NK cells are usually functionally exhausted in the tumour microenvironment. Strategies such as checkpoint blockades are under investigations to overcome NK cell exhaustion in order to boost anti-tumour immunity. The discovery and development of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology offer a flexible and efficient gene editing capability in modulating various pathways that mediate NK cell exhaustion, and in arming NK cells with novel chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) to specifically target tumour cells. Despite the high efficiency in its gene editing capability, difficulty in the delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system remains a major bottleneck for its therapeutic applications, particularly for NK cells. The current review discusses feasible approaches to deliver the CRISPR/Cas9 systems, as well as potential strategies in gene editing for NK cell immunotherapy for cancers.

1700	1700	658	Adipocyte	Insulin-induced lipid body accumulation is accompanied by lipid remodelling in model mast cells.	Mast cell lipid bodies are key to initiation, maintenance and resolution of inflammatory responses in tissue. Mast cell lines, primary bone marrow-derived mast cells and peripheral blood basophils present a 'steatotic' phenotype in response to chronic insulin exposure, where cells become loaded with lipid bodies. Here we show this state is associated with reduced histamine release, but increased capacity to release bioactive lipids. We describe the overall lipid phenotype of mast cells in this insulin-induced steatotic state and the consequences for critical cellular lipid classes involved in stages of inflammation. We show significant insulin-induced shifts in specific lipid classes, especially arachidonic acid derivatives, MUFA and PUFA, the EPA/DHA ratio, and in cardiolipins, especially those conjugated to certain DHA and EPAs. Functionally, insulin exposure markedly alters the FcεRI-induced release of Series 4 leukotriene LTC4, Series 2 prostaglandin PGD2, Resolvin-D1, Resolvin-D2 and Resolvin-1, reflecting the expanded precursor pools and impact on both the pro-inflammation and pro-resolution bioactive lipids that are released during mast cell activation. Chronic hyperinsulinemia is a feature of obesity and progression to Type 2 Diabetes, these data suggest that mast cell release of key lipid mediators is altered in patients with metabolic syndrome.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31311389	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311389	obesity	-583471248660258378

1703	1703	313	Scientific reports	Construction, Expression and Evaluation of Recombinant VP2 Protein for serotype-independent Detection of FMDV Seropositive Animals in Egypt.	Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is one of the most devastating viral pathogens of cloven-hoofed animals. The detection of antibodies (Ab) against FMDV structural proteins (SP) using virus neutralization test (VNT) and liquid-phase blocking ELISA (LPBE) is the standard procedure in use for monitoring seroconversion in animals post vaccination, the prevalence of infection-surveillance, proving clinical cases and seronegative status of FMDV-free/naïve-animals prior transportation. However, due to variations within SP of FMDV serotypes, each serotype-specific Ab should be detected separately which is laborious and time-consuming. Accordingly, it is crucial to develop a sensitive, rapid, and accurate test capable of detecting FMDV-specific Ab, regardless its serotype. This study describes the heterologous expression of VP2 protein in E. coli, and its evaluation as a capture antigen in a simple indirect ELISA for serotype-independent detection of anti-FMDV Ab. Sequence analysis revealed that the VP2-coding sequence is considerably conserved among FMDV serotypes. The recombinant VP2 (rVP2), a 22 kDa polypeptide, was purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography under native conditions. Immunoreactivity of the rVP2 was confirmed by using a panel of positive sera including sera from animals vaccinated with the local trivalent vaccine and guinea pig FMDV antiserum, which is routinely used as tracing/detecting Ab in LPBE testing. The results obtained from the VP2-based ELISA were comparable to those determined by VNT and LPBE standard diagnostic assays. Specificity and sensitivity of rVP2 in capturing anti-FMDV Ab were 98.3% and 100%, respectively. The developed VP2-ELISA is proved reliable and time-efficient assay for detection of FMDV seropositive animals, regardless the FMDV serotype that can be implemented in a combination with VNT and/or LPBE for rapid diagnosis of an ongoing FMDV infection.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31300744	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300744	vaccine	2633209697262372913

Chrysophanol (CHR), a purified active constituent extracted from Rheum palmatum L., possesses anti-inflammatory activity. This study aimed to evaluate its effects on asthma-associated airway inflammation and remodeling. BALB/c mice were sensitized and challenged by ovalbumin (OVA) and administrated with different doses of CHR. We found that CHR decreased OVA-induced pulmonary inflammation: the levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and inducible nitric oxide synthase were downregulated. CHR also attenuated airway remodeling induced by OVA challenge-CHR inhibited pulmonary α-smooth muscle actin expression. Moreover, both the nuclear translocation and activity of NF-κB p65 were inhibited by CHR in the asthmatic lung. Enhanced autophagy was initiated in the lung by OVA challenge as evidenced by upregulated light chain 3 beta, autophagy-related protein 5, and Beclin 1. CHR suppressed OVA-induced alterations in these autophagy-related molecules. In vitro, CHR (2 or 20 μM) was used to treat human pulmonary epithelial BEAS-2B cells in the presence of 10 ng/ml recombinant TNF-α. CHR not only exhibited the antiproliferation effect but also inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) signaling pathway in TNF-α-treated BEAS-2B cells. In conclusion, our study indicates that CHR has the potential to ameliorate asthma.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31313371	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313371	asthma	4068119742428755460

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of the full spectrum of mental illness in adolescents (aged 11 to 17) and adults (aged 18 to 64) with congenital heart defects (CHDs) in the population-level Colorado Congenital Heart Disease Surveillance System. Further we sought to investigate whether severity of the defect, frequency of recent cardiac procedures or underlying genetic disorders influence these estimates. The cohort included patients in clinical care for CHDs between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013, identified across multiple healthcare systems and insurance claims. Of 2,192 adolescents with CHDs, 20% were diagnosed with a mental illness with the most prevalent categories being developmental disorders (8%), anxiety disorders (6%), attention, conduct, behavior, impulse control disorders (6%), and mood disorders (5%). Of 6,924 adults with CHDs, 33% were diagnosed with a mental illness with the most prevalent categories being mood disorders (13%), anxiety disorders (13%), and substance-related disorders (6%). Greater lesion complexity was associated with a higher likelihood of anxiety and developmental disorders in both adolescents and adults. Adolescents and adults who had ≥2 cardiac procedures in the 3-year surveillance period had a 3- and 4.5-fold higher likelihood of a mental illness diagnosis, respectively, compared with those who had fewer than 2 cardiac procedures. Finally, patients with a genetic syndrome were more likely to have a mental illness diagnosis. In conclusion, mental illness is a prevalent co-morbidity in the adolescent and adult population with CHDs, thus comprehensive care should include mental health care.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31303246	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303246	heart+disease	-6504694273023533189

1707	1707	112	PloS one	Undetected tuberculosis at enrollment and after hospitalization in medical and oncology wards in Botswana.	Cancer patients are at higher risk of tuberculosis (TB) infection, especially in hospital settings with high TB/HIV burden. The study was implemented among adult patients admitted to the largest tertiary-level referral hospital in Botswana. We estimated the TB prevalence at admission and the rate of newly diagnosed TB after hospitalization in the medical and oncology wards, separately. Presumptive TB cases were identified at admission through symptom screening and underwent the diagnostic evaluation through GeneXpert. Patients with no evidence of TB were followed-up until TB diagnosis or the end of the study. In the medical and oncology wards, four of 867 admitted patients and two of 240 had laboratory-confirmed TB at admission (prevalence = 461.4 and 833.3 per 100,000, respectively.) The post-admission TB rate from the medical wards was 28.3 cases per 1,000 person-year during 424.5 follow-up years (post-admission TB rate among HIV-positive versus. -negative = 54.1 and 9.8 per 1,000 person-year, respectively [Rate Ratio = 5.5]). No post-admission TB case was detected from the oncology ward. High rates of undetected TB at admission at both medical and oncology wards, and high rate of newly diagnosed TB after admission at medical wards suggest that TB screening and diagnostic evaluation should target all patients admitted to a hospital in high-burden settings.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31295315	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295315	tuberculosis	882422233694040097
1708	1708	6	Free radical biology & medicine	Age-dependent dysregulation of redox genes may contribute to fibrotic pulmonary disease susceptibility.	Aging is associated with enhanced oxidative stress and increased susceptibility to numerous diseases. This relationship is particularly striking with respect to the incidence of fibrotic lung disease. To identify potential mechanisms underlying the association between aging and susceptibility to fibrotic lung disease we analyzed transcriptome data from 342 disease-free human lung samples as a function of donor age. Our analysis reveals that aging in lung is accompanied by modest yet progressive changes in genes modulating redox homeostasis, the TGF-beta 1 signaling axis, and the extracellular matrix (ECM), pointing to an aging lung functional network (ALFN). Further, the transcriptional changes we document are tissue-specific, with age-dependent gene expression patterns differing across organ systems. Our findings suggest that the age-associated increased incidence of fibrotic pulmonary disease occurs in the context of tissue-specific, age-dependent transcriptional changes. Understanding the relationship between age-associated gene expression and susceptibility to fibrotic pulmonary disease may allow for more accurate risk stratification and effective therapeutic interventions within this challenging clinical space.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31315063	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315063	aging	-6643406494673362190

Short-term administration of the entry inhibitor Mycludex-B (MyrB) has been shown to be safe and effective in phase II studies in HBV/HDV co-infected patients. However, its effectiveness and safety during long-term and high-dose treatment in compensated cirrhotics in real-life settings are unknown. Here we describe the first three European patients with HDV-related compensated cirrhosis who were treated with MyrB 10 mg/day for 48 weeks as a compassionate therapy. Liver function tests, bile acids, and virological markers were monitored every 4 weeks. In two cases, also HDV/HBV-specific T cell quantity (up to 48 and 36 weeks) and HBV RNA levels were assessed. During MyrB treatment, HDV RNA levels progressively declined from 4.4 and 5.6 logs IU/mL to undetectability for the first two cases, and from 6.8 log cp/mL to 500 cp/mL for the other patient. ALT normalized in 20, 12 and 28 weeks, respectively. A significant improvement in portal hypertension features, liver function tests and AFP levels were documented in two cases. In the male patient with histological and clinical stigmata of autoimmune hepatitis, IgG and immunoglobulins rapidly normalized. No significant changes of HBsAg levels and circulating HDV/HBV-specific T cells were demonstrated; HBV DNA and HBV RNA levels remained undetectable throughout the study period. MyrB was well tolerated; patients remained fully asymptomatic despite a significant increase of bile acids. In conclusion, this report shows excellent safety and effectiveness of a 48-week course of MyrB 10 mg/day, combined with TDF, for the treatment of HDV compensated cirrhosis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31302176	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302176	Cirrhosis	5658615529969625284

Resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs is increasing rapidly in this region. The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Sindh, Pakistan. Methods We conducted a prospective, observational study in the department of pulmonology at Civil Hospital, Jamshoro. A total of 169 patients with smear-positive sputum after two months of compliant therapy with first line anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT) were included in the study. Drug susceptibility testing was performed; this involved the preparation and testing of a concentration series of drugs against the Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis complex. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software Version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, US). Results Overall, the frequency of MDR-TB patients being treated with first-line ATT was 40.2% (68/169). Among these cases of MDR-TB, there were 36 (53%) men and 32 (47%) women. The most common second-line drug resistance was to ofloxacin (43.2%; n=73). Conclusions The growing drug resistance of M. tuberculosis is a problem in Pakistan, and measures should be taken to reduce the incidence of resistance, including increasing patient compliance to therapy.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31281754	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31281754	tuberculosis	1768976290984301641

The phenomenon is also observed in rodents, where neonatal-maternal separation, a model of early life stress, induces phenotypes similar to IBS; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unelucidated. Our recent study provided a mechanism for the pathogenesis in the gut, demonstrating that increased visceral hyperalgesia resulted from the expansion of the intestinal stem cell compartment leading to increased differentiation and proliferation of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine/5-HT)-producing enterochromaffin cells. Moreover, it identified nerve growth factor (NGF) as a key mediator of the pathogenesis; surprisingly, it exerts its effect via cross talk with Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This article addresses the roles of NGF in driving IBS and its potential clinical implications, outstanding questions in how psychological stimuli are transduced into physical phenotypes, as well as future directions of our findings. 	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31272268	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31272268	Diarrhea	-3351990231604537690

A 72-year-old female patient who was admitted for ischaemic stroke had developed ascending cholangitis. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram was performed to drain the infected bile, but this was complicated by haemorrhagic shock and hepatic haematoma. Mesenteric angiogram showed right hepatic artery (RHA) pseudoaneurysm which was embolised, there by stopping her bleeding. RHA is normally located posterior to common bile duct (CBD). An uncommon location of RHA is anterior to CBD, which can lead to haemorrhagic complications during percutaneous cholangiogram.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31302620	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302620	stroke	-1968251596393236557
1728	1728	30	PloS one	Effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids on proliferation and survival of prostate cancer cells.	Progression of prostate cancer to lethal forms is marked by emergence of hormone-independent proliferation of the cancer cells. Nutritional and epidemiological studies have indicated that prostate cancer progression is correlated with the consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). To shed additional light on the cell-level mechanisms of the observed correlation, we compared the sensitivity of hormone-dependent and hormone-independent prostate cancer cells to growth medium supplementation with free PUFAs in a cell proliferation and viability assay. Our data show that the hormone-dependent cells are comparatively insensitive to various PUFAs, at the same time as the growth and viability of hormone-independent cells lines are strongly inhibited by most of the tested PUFAs, whether n-3 or n-6. We speculate that this difference may be at least partially responsible for the observed effects of specific dietary lipids in prostate cancer. The new data strengthen the case for dietary intervention as part of potential new therapeutic strategies seeking to impede prostate cancer progression.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31314803	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314803	cancer	464601875539492971

Lactate clearance (Δ24Lac) was reported to be inversely associated with mortality in critically ill patients. The aim of our study was to assess the value of Δ24Lac for the prognosis of critically ill patients with cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). We analysed 954 cirrhotic patients with hyperlactatemia admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in the United States and eastern China. The patients were followed up for at least 1 year. In the unadjusted model, we observed a 15% decrease in hospital mortality with each 10% increase in Δ24Lac. In the fully adjusted model, the relationship between the risk of death and Δ24Lac remained statistically significant (hospital mortality: odds ratio [OR] 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.78- 0.90, p < 0.001; 90-day mortality: hazard ratio [HR] 0.94, 95%CI 0.92- 0.97, p < 0.001; for Δ24Lac per 10% increase). Similar results were found in patients with ACLF. We developed a Δ24Lac-adjusted score (LiFe-Δ24Lac), which performed significantly better in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) than the original LiFe score for predicting mortality. Lactate clearance is an independent predictor of death, and the LiFe-Δ24Lac score is a practical tool for stratifying the risk of death.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31259742	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31259742	Cirrhosis	4865901874365409673

As the severity of cirrhosis increases which is indicated by Child Pugh A to C, serum level of T3 reduces and findings were statistically significant (p value 0.00).All 50 patients of cirrhosis had their serum T4 level within normal limit and it does not change with severity of liver disease. This study found association between serum FT4 and severity of liver disease. As the severity of cirrhosis increases which is indicated by Child Pugh A to C, serum level of FT4 fall in low-normal or below normal value and findings were statistically significant (p value 0.00). This study found association between serum FT3 and severity of liver disease. As the severity of cirrhosis increases which is indicated by Child Pugh A to C, serum level of FT3 reduces. All patients of Child Pugh C had low FT3 level and the findings were statistically significant (p value 0.00). This study showed that serum bilirubin, prothombin time, INR, TSH level increases and serum albumin level, T3, FT3, and FT4 level reduces as the severity of cirrhosis increases.According to this study all cirrhotic patients should undergo thyroid function evaluation as these patients are definitely associated with development of hypothyroidism. There is significant inverse correlation between serum level of T3, FT3, and FT4 with severity of cirrhosis. These parameters can be used as markers to indicate the severity of cirrhosis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	India	31304707	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304707	Cirrhosis	4597139024287190193

E-cigarette advertisements often express this message implicitly (e.g., ""Whenever, wherever"") alongside images of e-cigarettes that physically resemble combustible cigarettes. These implicit messages and ""cigalike"" images may cross-cue combustible cigarette smoking cognitions and behavior. This exploratory study was a 2 (message form: implicit or explicit e-cigarette use anywhere message) by 2 (presence or absence of e-cigarette cue) experiment with U.S. adult smokers (n = 2,201). Participants were randomized to view e-cigarette advertisements that varied by study condition. Three combustible cigarette outcomes were investigated: smoking cessation intention, smoking urges, and immediate smoking behavior. Mediation analysis was also performed to investigate mechanisms of the message form effect through descriptive and normative beliefs about smoking. Compared to its explicit counterpart, the implicit e-cigarette use anywhere message evoked greater smoking urges. Participants exposed to the implicit message also perceived cigarette smoking to be more prevalent and, in turn, reported greater cessation intention. There was no evidence of e-cigarette cue or message form × cue interaction effects. Implicit e-cigarette use anywhere messages may create a predisposition towards smoking compared to their explicitly written counterparts, but whether this effect undermines cessation deserves further attention."	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31298632	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298632	smoking	2051327203770554158

Evolution is widely observable in laboratory and natural populations as they change over time. The fact that we need annual flu vaccines is one example of observable evolution. At the same time, evolutionary theory explains more than observations, as the succession on the fossil record. Hence, evolution is also the scientific theory that embodies biology, including all organisms and their characteristics. In this paper, we emphasize why evolution is the most important theory in biology. Evolution explains every biological detail, similar to how history explains many aspects of a current political situation. Only evolution explains the patterns observed in the fossil record. Examples include the succession in the fossil record; we cannot find the easily fossilized mammals before 300 million years ago; after the extinction of the dinosaurs, the fossil record indicates that mammals and birds radiated throughout the planet. Additionally, the fact that we are able to construct fairly consistent phylogenetic trees using distinct genetic markers in the genome is only explained by evolutionary theory. Finally, we show that the processes that drive evolution, both on short and long time scales, are observable facts.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Brazil	30816905	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30816905	flu	-1596335233529956315

We performed a clinical observational descriptive study in which, during three years, we followed the evolution of 81 patients who were diagnosed with left main coronary artery disease and who were treated either by interventional revascularization by stent implantation, by surgical revascularization by performing an aortic-coronary bypass. In our study the risk factors according to which the evolution of the patients was observed were represented by diabetes, smoking, age and gender. The primary endpoint was mortality from any cause and other clinical endpoints were the reduction of left ventricular ejection fraction, symptomatic ischemic heart disease manifested by angina pectoris, non-procedural myocardial infarction or need for repeated revascularization. In our study diabetes was the risk factor that negatively influenced the evolution of patients with LMCAD treated either by PCI or by CABG for the most part, followed by smoking, male gender and age over 65 years.	2019	eng	Case Reports	Romania	31297258	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297258	heart+disease	123378787151399958

The current gold standard for measuring antibody-based immunity to influenza viruses relies on the hemagglutinin inhibition assay (HAI), an 80-year-old technology, and the microneutralization assay (MN). Both assays use serial dilution to provide a discrete, ranked readout of 8-14 categorical titer values for each sample. In contrast to other methods of measuring vaccine antibody levels that produce a continuous readout (i.e., mPLEX-Flu and ELISA), titering methods introduce imprecision and increase false discovery rates (FDR). In this paper, we assess the degree of such statistical errors, first with simulation studies comparing continuous data with titer data in influenza vaccine study group comparison analyses and then by analyzing actual sample data from an influenza vaccine trial. Our results show the superiority of using continuous, rather than discrete, readout assays. Compared to continuous readout assays, titering assays have a lower statistical precision and a higher FDR. The results suggested that traditional titering assays could lead to increased Type-II errors in the comparison of different therapeutic arms of an influenza vaccine trial. These statistical issues are related to the mathematical nature of titer-based assays, which we examine in detail in the simulation studies. Continuous readout assays are free of this issue, and thus it is possible that comparisons of study groups could provide different results with these two methods as we have shown in our case study.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31205481	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31205481	flu	5533752987392101383

Domestic cats (Felis catus) are known to develop cognitive impairment, and several small series have demonstrated both β-amyloid and tau aggregation, including neurofibrillary tangles, with age, making them a promising physiologic model of Alzheimer disease (AD). We therefore report the largest feline autopsy cohort to date of 32 cats ranging from 1.5 to 22.1 years of age, with systematic neuropathologic assessment according to NIA-Alzheimer's Association Criteria. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections of brain were obtained retrospectively from cats autopsied at the Iowa State College of Veterinary Medicine. We found β-amyloid staining, predominantly in Cortical Layers IV and VI in 27 of the 32 cats used in the study, with four of these animals showing tau-positive tangles and neuropil threads. In 75% of these cases (3/4), tau deposition was limited to entorhinal cortex, while one case showed diffuse positive staining throughout the hippocampal formation and neocortex. This last case showed positive staining for all phospho-tau-specific antibodies tested, similar to the pattern seen in human AD. Interestingly, we saw a higher ratio of pretangles to tangles than that in human AD, and none of the cases showed neuritic plaques on any of the stains used. Our findings indicate that aging domestic cats spontaneously develop both β-amyloid and tau pathology similar, but not identical to that seen in human AD. This suggests that the domestic cat may serve as a potential model for mechanistic and therapeutic AD studies, but that additional research is needed to identify differences between the neuropathology of aging in humans and felines.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31273784	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31273784	Alzheimer	-1564468014116140117

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is among the leading causes of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis globally, with a high economic burden. The disease progression is well established, but less is known about the spontaneous HCV infection clearance. This study tries to establish the relationship between codon biasness and expression of HCV clearance candidate genes in normal and HCV infected liver tissues. A total of 112 coding sequences comprising 151 679 codons were subjected to the computation of codon indices, namely relative synonymous codon usage, an effective number of codon (Nc), frequency of optimal codon, codon adaptation index, codon bias index, and base compositions. Codon indices report of GC3s, GC12, hydropathicity, and aromaticity implicates both mutational and translational selection in the candidate gene set. This was further correlated with the differentially expressed genes among the selected genes using BioGPS. A significant correlation is observed between the gene expression of normal liver and cancerous liver tissues with codon bias (Nc). Gene expression is also correlated with relative codon bias values, indicating that CCL5, APOA2, CD28, IFITM1, and TNFSF4 genes have higher expression. These results are quite encouraging in selecting the high responsive genes in HCV clearance. However, there could be additional genes which could also orchestrate the clearance role with the above mentioned first line of defensive genes.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31310376	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310376	Cirrhosis	8622597251681699865

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) a re-emerging mosquito-borne alpha virus causes significant distress which is further accentuated in the lack of specific therapeutics or a preventive vaccine, mandating accelerated research for anti-CHIKV therapeutics. In recent years, drug repositioning has gained recognition for the curative interventions for its cost and time efficacy. CHIKV envelope proteins are considered to be the promising targets for drug discovery because of their essential role in viral attachment and entry in the host cells. In the current study, we propose structure-based virtual screening of drug molecule on the crystal structure of mature Chikungunya envelope protein (PDB 3N41) using a library of FDA approved drug molecules. Several cephalosporin drugs docked successfully within two binding sites prepared at E1-E2 interface of CHIKV envelop protein complex with significantly low binding energies. Cefmenoxime, ceforanide, cefotetan, cefonicid sodium and cefpiramide were identified as top leads with a cumulative score of -67.67, -64.90, -63.78, -61.99, and - 61.77, forming electrostatic, hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds within both the binding sites. These shortlisted leads could be potential inhibitors of E1-E2 hetero dimer in CHIKV, hence might disrupt the integrity of envelope glycoprotein leading to loss of its ability to form mature viral particles and gain entry into the host.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Singapore	31312082	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312082	vaccine	8297658253225035519

Pulmonary fibrosis is an emerging disease with a poor prognosis and high mortality rate that is even surpassing some types of cancer. This disease has been linked to the concomitant appearance of liver cirrhosis. Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis is a widely used mouse model that mimics the histopathological and biochemical features of human systemic sclerosis, an autoimmune disease that is associated with inflammation and expressed in several corporal systems as fibrosis or other alterations. To determine the effects on proliferation, redox and inflammation protein expression markers were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Analyses showed a significant increase in protein oxidation levels by lipoperoxidation bio-products and in proliferation and inflammation processes. These phenomena were associated with the induction of the redox status in mice subjected to 100 U/kg bleomycin. These findings clearly show that the bleomycin model induces histopathological alterations in the liver and partially reproduces the complexity of systemic sclerosis. Our results using the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model provide a protocol to investigate the mechanism underlying the molecular alteration found in the liver linked to systemic sclerosis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31312848	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312848	Cirrhosis	-7891293130731329672
1766	1766	148	Journal of extracellular vesicles	Acetylcholinesterase is not a generic marker of extracellular vesicles.	"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity is found in abundance in reticulocytes and neurons and was developed as a marker of reticulocyte EVs in the 1970s. Easily, quickly, and cheaply assayed, AChE activity has more recently been proposed as a generic marker for small extracellular vesicles (sEV) or exosomes, and as a negative marker of HIV-1 virions. To evaluate these proposed uses of AChE activity, we examined data from different EV and virus isolation methods using T-lymphocytic (H9, PM1 and Jurkat) and promonocytic (U937) cell lines grown in culture conditions that differed by serum content. When EVs were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation, no correlation between AChE activity and particle count was observed. AChE activity was detected in non-conditioned medium when serum was added, and most of this activity resided in soluble fractions and could not be pelleted by centrifugation. The serum-derived pelletable AChE protein was not completely eliminated from culture medium by overnight ultracentrifugation; however, a serum ""extra-depletion"" protocol, in which a portion of the supernatant was left undisturbed during harvesting, achieved near-complete depletion. In conditioned medium also, only small percentages of AChE activity could be pelleted together with particles. Furthermore, no consistent enrichment of AChE activity in sEV fractions was observed. Little if any AChE activity is produced by the cells we examined, and this activity was mainly present in non-vesicular structures, as shown by electron microscopy. Size-exclusion chromatography and iodixanol gradient separation showed that AChE activity overlaps only minimally with EV-enriched fractions. AChE activity likely betrays exposure to blood products and not EV abundance, echoing the MISEV 2014 and 2018 guidelines and other publications. Additional experiments may be merited to validate these results for other cell types and biological fluids other than blood."	2019	eng	Journal Article	Sweden	31303981	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303981	HIV	-4718837078135183000

Autobiographical memory, which contains all personal memories relative to our identity, has been found to be impaired in Alzheimer' Disease (AD). Recent research has demonstrated that odor may serve as a powerful cue for the recovery of autobiographical memories in AD. Building on this research, we investigated emotional characteristics (arousal and valence) and subjective reliving of odor-evoked autobiographical memories in AD. We also investigated the relationship between these characteristics and depression. To this end, we invited participants with mild AD and controls to retrieve autobiographical memories after odor exposure or without odor. Results showed higher arousal, subjective reliving and more positive memories after odor exposure compared with the odor-free condition, these differences being observed only in AD participants. We also found that emotion (arousal and valence) and subjective reliving triggered by odor were associated with depressive symptoms in AD. These findings demonstrate that odor may be a useful cue to trigger more detailed, vivid and positive events in AD.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31185649	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31185649	Alzheimer	-5527182266336855540

Here, we analyzed oral tolerance induction, components of the intestinal barrier, fecal microbiota, and immune cell phenotypes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice during disease progression compared to non-obese diabetes resistant (NOR) mice. NOD mice failed to develop oral tolerance and had defective protective/regulatory mechanisms in the intestinal mucosa, including decreased numbers of goblet cells, diminished mucus production, and lower levels of total and bacteria-bound secretory IgA, as well as an altered IEL profile. These disturbances correlated with bacteria translocation to the pancreatic lymph node possibly contributing to T1D onset. The composition of the fecal microbiota was altered in pre-diabetic NOD mice, and cross-fostering of NOD mice by NOR mothers corrected their defect in mucus production, indicating a role for NOD microbiota in gut barrier dysfunction.

Patients who receive weight loss advice from a health care provider (HCP) are more likely to eat healthy. The food environment affects eating behaviors. This study explored how the community food environment may moderate the relationship between HCP advice to lose weight and eating behaviors. Data were obtained from a household telephone survey in 4 New Jersey cities from two cross-sectional panels (2009-10 and 2014). Analyses were limited to 1427 overweight and obese participants. Self-reports assessed frequency of consumption of fruits, vegetables, sugar sweetened beverages, and fast food. Community food data were purchased from InfoUSA and Nielsen and classified according to previously established protocol. Stratified gamma regression analysis determined the differences in the association between receiving weight loss advice and eating behaviors stratified by community food environment. Stratified analyses revealed that receiving advice to lose weight from a HCP was associated with lower reported consumption of total sugar-sweetened beverages, soda, and sweetened fruit drinks when participants lived near a small grocery store, or far from a supermarket, limited service restaurant, or convenience store. There were no associations between receiving weight loss advice and sugar sweetened beverage consumption when participants lived near supermarkets, limited service restaurants, or convenience stores. There were no associations with fruit, vegetable, salad or fast-food consumption, regardless of the community food environment. Food environment may play a critical role in moderating the association between HCP advice and eating behaviors. Interventions that enhance the community food environment may help convert HCP advice into improved eating behaviors.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31312593	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312593	obesity	-5491334714953807444

One in four patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has depression. However, the effect of depressive symptoms on self-reported physical function among patients with COPD is not fully defined. We tested the hypothesis that depressive symptoms among patients with COPD are associated with increased self-reporting of physical limitations in a nationally representative sample of adults living in the USA. We sampled 775 adults with obstructive lung disease and history of regular smoking from 2007 to 2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios for the association between depressive symptoms and self-reported difficulty performing three activities. We used a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score ≥ 10 to define depressive symptoms. Covariates in the multivariable analysis were age, gender, percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second, current smoking, low-income status, and number of co-morbidities. In models predicting any difficulty walking a quarter mile, walking up 10 stairs, and walking between rooms on a level surface, adjusted odds ratio estimates (95% CI) for depressive symptoms were 2.03 (1.06, 3.88), 3.40 (1.77, 6.50), and 4.92 (2.29, 10.60), respectively. The presence of depressive symptoms was associated with increased self-reported difficulty with physical activities in our sample. Unexpectedly, the effect of depressive symptoms was greater with easier activities in our sample. These results suggest that depressive symptoms are associated with activity-dependent self-reporting of physical limitations among patients with COPD.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31298042	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298042	smoking	6504364365389213533

Our previous finding demonstrated that chronic corticosterone (CORT) may be involved in mediating the pathophysiology of premature aging in rats. Frequent jet lag increases the risk for many diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, and is associated with the aging processes. However, the effect of jet lag on CORT-induced depression and its association with aging phenotypes remain unclear. In this study, the rats were exposed to both CORT and jet lag treatment, and the differences were analyzed and compared to rats with single CORT treatment. Our results showed that jet lag treatment aggravated CORT-induced depression-like behavior evidenced by sucrose intake test, forced swimming test, and open field test. Additionally, this treatment aggravated the shortening of telomeres, which possibly resulted in decreased telomerase activity, and downregulated the expression of telomere-binding factor 2 (TRF2) and telomerase reverse transcriptase compared to that in CORT rats, as revealed by quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. The shortening of telomeres may have been caused by increased oxidative stress, which was associated with the inhibition of sirtuin 3. Exposure to jet lag also aggravated the degeneration of mitochondrial functions, as shown by the decreases in the mRNA expression of COX1, ND1, and Tfam. Our findings provide physiological evidence that jet lag exposure may worsen stress-induced depression and age-related abnormalities.	2019	eng	Journal Article	China	31314053	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314053	diabetes	-1006791494035379303

Characterization of granulomatous lesions of Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) experimentally infected cattle has helped to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease. However, few studies have described granulomas found in M. bovis naturally infected cattle. The aim of this work was to examine granulomas from Holstein-Friesian cattle naturally infected with M. bovis from a dairy basin located in the central region of Mexico. Tissue samples from thirty-two cattle with lesions suggestive of tuberculosis were collected post-mortem. Fifteen of the 32 sampled animals (46.8%) were 4 months of age or younger (calves), whereas the rest (53.2%, 17/32) were over one year old (adults). Macroscopic lesions suggestive of tuberculosis were found in the mediastinal lymph node chain of all animals (32/32). From the 1,143 granulomatous lesions that were microscopically analyzed, 34.6% (396/1143) were collected from adult animals and subsequently classified according to the nomenclature suggested by Wangoo et al., 2005. Surprisingly, lesions from calf tissues showed an atypical pattern which could not be fitted into the established developmental stages of this classification. Granulomatous lesions found in calves covered most of the affected organ, histologically showed large necrotic areas with central calcification, absence of a connective tissue capsule, and few giant cells. Also, there was a higher percentage of lesions with acid-fast bacilli (AFB) when compared to studied granulomas in adults. Growth of Mycobacterium spp was detected in 11 bacteriological tissue cultures. Genotypic identification of M. bovis was performed by DNA extraction from bacterial isolates, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues and samples without bacterial isolation. M. bovis was detected by PCR in 84.3% (27/32) of the studied cases; whereas other AFB were observed in tissues of the remaining sampled animals (5/32). Our results describe atypical granuloma formation in calves 4 months of age or younger, naturally infected with M. bovis. These findings contribute to better understanding the physiopathology of M. bovis infection in cattle.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31306432	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306432	tuberculosis	-4291244850221551577
1787	1787	215	Clinical & translational immunology	Harnessing host-virus evolution in antiviral therapy and immunotherapy.	Pathogen resistance and development costs are major challenges in current approaches to antiviral therapy. The high error rate of RNA synthesis and reverse-transcription confers genome plasticity, enabling the remarkable adaptability of RNA viruses to antiviral intervention. However, this property is coupled to fundamental constraints including limits on the size of information available to manipulate complex hosts into supporting viral replication. Accordingly, RNA viruses employ various means to extract maximum utility from their informationally limited genomes that, correspondingly, may be leveraged for effective host-oriented therapies. Host-oriented approaches are becoming increasingly feasible because of increased availability of bioactive compounds and recent advances in immunotherapy and precision medicine, particularly genome editing, targeted delivery methods and RNAi. In turn, one driving force behind these innovations is the increasingly detailed understanding of evolutionarily diverse host-virus interactions, which is the key concern of an emerging field, neo-virology. This review examines biotechnological solutions to disease and other sustainability issues of our time that leverage the properties of RNA and DNA viruses as developed through co-evolution with their hosts.	2019	eng	Review	Australia	31312450	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312450	vaccine	5847540986736720765

The purpose of this study was to discuss the mental and physical effects of using music therapy with patients suffering with dementia. Like any type of therapy, there are guidelines for measuring the effects. Music therapy can be used as a substitute for pharmaceuticals with dementia patients. The earlier the diagnosis and the earlier treatment commences for dementia patients, the more likely the treatment will work. Music therapy can reach the part of the brain where we hold memories, which is why it is used as a treatment option for dementia patients. Alzheimer disease and dementia are among the most expensive diseases to treat. However, if the onset of dementia can be delayed, money can be saved. Medicare does not require that music therapy be offered in assisted living, nursing homes, or hospices. Areas of cost savings were identified as use of medication, length of nursing visits, and number and length of home health-aid visits, which can all be measured in total cost savings. For health care managers, it is imperative that new therapies such as music therapy be applied in health care facilities that treat dementia patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31261197	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31261197	Alzheimer	-2929967869758467182

Because AD pathologies begin two decades before the onset of dementia, prevention of Aβ amyloidosis has been proposed as a mean to block the pathological cascade. Here, we generate a transgenic plant-based vaccine, a soybean storage protein containing Aβ4-10, named Aβ+, for oral Aβ immunization. One mg of Aβ+ or control protein (Aβ-) was administered to TgCRND8 mice once a week from 9 weeks up to 58 weeks. Aβ+ immunization raised both anti-Aβ antibodies and cellular immune responses. Spatial learning decline was prevented in the Aβ+ immunized group in an extended reference memory version of Morris water maze test from 21 to 57 weeks. In Tris-buffered saline (TBS), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and formic acid (FA) serial extractions, all sets of Aβ species from Aβ monomer, low to high molecular weight Aβ oligomers, and Aβ smears had different solubility in TgCRND8 brains. Aβ oligomers decreased in TBS fractions, corresponding to an increase in high molecular weight Aβ oligomers in SDS extracts and Aβ smears in FA fraction of the Aβ+ treated group. There was significant inhibition of histological Aβ burden, especially in diffuse plaques, and suppression of microglial inflammation. Processing of amyloid-β protein precursor was not different between Aβ+ and Aβ- groups. No evidence of amyloid-related inflammatory angiopathy was observed. Thus, Aβ+ oral immunization could be a promising, cheap, and long-term safe disease-modifying therapy to prevent the pathological process in AD.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31177217	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31177217	Alzheimer	-1868592694876567759

The 1918 Spanish flu virus has claimed more than 50 million lives. However, the mechanism of its high pathogenicity remains elusive; and the origin of the virus is controversial. The matrix (M) segment regulates the replication of influenza A virus, thereby affecting its virulence and pathogenicity. This study found that the M segment of the Spanish flu virus is a recombinant chimera originating from avian influenza virus and human influenza virus. The unique mosaic M segment might confer the virus high replication capacity, showing that the recombination might play an important role in inducing high pathogenicity of the virus. In addition, this study also suggested that the NA and NS segments of the virus were generated by reassortment between mammalian and avian viruses. Direct phylogenetic evidence was also provided for its avian origin.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31241237	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31241237	flu	8378863480597222815

A systematic search was conducted in electronic databases using obesity as the main term along with anthocyanins and the main anthocyanidins, including articles in Portuguese, English, and Spanish without any restriction as to year. The review was carried out by peers following PRISMA recommendations: 1980 studies were identified, and 19 articles were analyzed. The studies varied in relation to time, pathways, cells used, and anthocyanin types. The positive effects were observed in 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase pathways and mitochondrial biogenesis and in a reduction in inflammation and oxidative stress. Anthocyanins can improve the metabolic control involved in obesity by reducing lipogenesis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. This can boost the speed of lipolysis and thermogenesis, regulate satiety, and reduce body fat accumulation. In addition, anthocyanins have shown promising effects on controlling obesity compared with the standard of care.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31310961	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310961	stress	-860751600992244121

The phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mTOR (PI3K/AkT/mTOR) pathway plays a pivotal role in the uncontrolled growth, migration and development of human breast cancer. The elevated expression of TGF-β1 increases the PI3K/AkT/mTOR activity in human breast cancer tissue and potentially motivates tumor metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy. Here, we investigated whether treatment with PI3K/AkT/mTOR dual inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 alone or in combination with caffeic acid phenyl ester (CAPE) could prevent TGF-β1 effects on breast cancer cells. MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were exposed to TGF-β1 for 14 days and then were treated with/without NVP-BEZ235 and/or CAPE. Cell viability, apoptosis, CXCR4 surface expression and mRNA levels of CXCR4 and TWIST-1 were analyzed in all treated groups. We found that treatment of human breast cancer cells with a combination of NVP-BEZ235 and CAPE increased induction of cellular death. Although flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that NVP-BEZ235 alone treatment reduced CXCR4 expression while increasing CXCR4 mRNA level; when NVP-BEZ235 was combined with CAPE, inhibition of CXCR4 surface expression and enhancement of CXCR4 mRNA expression was diminished. In addition, TWIST-1 mRNA expression was down regulated in samples treated with both NVP-BEZ235 and CAPE. These altogether signified that NVP-BEZ235 in combination with CAPE showed improved therapeutic efficacy in breast cancer cells by decreasing apoptotic resistance and reduction of CXCR4 and TWIST-1 expression at mRNA level could be one of mechanism of action.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31313132	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313132	cancer	-7195227263752331646

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and homocysteine (Hcy) are inflammation markers but are also related to cardiovascular diseases, disability or higher risk of death. Although inflammation is considered to be associated with frailty, data regarding the association between hsCRP or Hcy and frailty are controversial or scarce, especially with respect to their association with pre-frailty. Thus, our objective was to study the association of hsCRP and Hcy with pre-frailty and frailty in 1211 Spanish men and women aged 65-98 years from the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging (TSHA) cohort, classified according to Fried's criteria. Hcy was independently associated with frailty (OR=1.06; 95% CI, 1.01 - 1.12), while hsCRP was independently associated with both pre-frailty (OR=1.03; 95% CI, 1.01 - 1.06) and frailty (OR=1.07; 95% CI, 1.02 - 1.12). Furthermore, both markers were positively correlated with the number of Fried's criteria that were met and were independently associated with the criteria of exhaustion (Hcy: OR=1.03, 95% CI, 1.00 - 1.06), weakness (hsCRP: OR=1.03, 95% CI, 1.01 - 1.05) and low physical activity (hsCRP: OR=1.04, 95% CI, 1.02 - 1.06). Thus, our results highlight the importance of inflammation in age-related physical decline and, in particular, its association with fatigue, low strength and decreased physical activity.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31304964	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304964	aging	8541347773340490171

Aging is associated with enhanced oxidative stress and increased susceptibility to numerous diseases. This relationship is particularly striking with respect to the incidence of fibrotic lung disease. To identify potential mechanisms underlying the association between aging and susceptibility to fibrotic lung disease we analyzed transcriptome data from 342 disease-free human lung samples as a function of donor age. Our analysis reveals that aging in lung is accompanied by modest yet progressive changes in genes modulating redox homeostasis, the TGF-beta 1 signaling axis, and the extracellular matrix (ECM), pointing to an aging lung functional network (ALFN). Further, the transcriptional changes we document are tissue-specific, with age-dependent gene expression patterns differing across organ systems. Our findings suggest that the age-associated increased incidence of fibrotic pulmonary disease occurs in the context of tissue-specific, age-dependent transcriptional changes. Understanding the relationship between age-associated gene expression and susceptibility to fibrotic pulmonary disease may allow for more accurate risk stratification and effective therapeutic interventions within this challenging clinical space.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31315063	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315063	stress	3582716808949240433

Epidemiological studies demonstrate that dimensions of retinal vessels change with ocular diseases, coronary heart disease and stroke. Different metrics have been described to quantify these changes in fundus images, with arteriolar and venular calibers among the most widely used. The analysis often includes a manual procedure during which a trained grader differentiates between arterioles and venules. This step can be time-consuming and can introduce variability, especially when large volumes of images need to be analyzed. In light of the recent successes of fully convolutional networks (FCNs) applied to biomedical image segmentation, we assess its potential in the context of retinal artery-vein (A/V) discrimination. To the best of our knowledge, a deep learning (DL) architecture for simultaneous vessel extraction and A/V discrimination has not been previously employed. With the aim of improving the automation of vessel analysis, a novel application of the U-Net semantic segmentation architecture (based on FCNs) on the discrimination of arteries and veins in fundus images is presented. By utilizing DL, results are obtained that exceed accuracies reported in the literature. Our model was trained and tested on the public DRIVE and HRF datasets. For DRIVE, measuring performance on vessels wider than two pixels, the FCN achieved accuracies of 94.42% and 94.11% on arteries and veins, respectively. This represents a decrease in error of 25% over the previous state of the art reported by Xu et al. (2017). Additionally, we introduce the HRF A/V ground truth, on which our model achieves 96.98% accuracy on all discovered centerline pixels.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 cause 70% of cervical cancer cases globally. The nonavalent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) was licensed in 2014 and protects against the next five most common cancer-causing HPV types (HPV 31/33/45/52/58) after HPV 16/18. Phase III clinical studies have demonstrated high vaccine efficacy (>90%) against cervical, vulvar, and vaginal precancers caused by these additional types, and have shown comparable immunogenicity to the shared genotypes to quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV). Vaccine efficacy and antibody responses for 9vHPV are found to persist for at least five years while longer-term observational studies are ongoing to monitor long-term vaccine effectiveness. The implementation of 9vHPV has the potential to prevent up to 93% of cervical cancer cases, as well as a significant proportion of other HPV-related anogenital cancers. This review article summarizes the current evidence for 9vHPV in terms of vaccine efficacy against HPV infection and related anogenital precancers, safety, and immunogenicity, as well as discussing the potential impact of this vaccine on the cervical cancer burden globally.	2019	eng	Review	New Zealand	31308715	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308715	vaccine	-559964548932224920

Apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays a crucial role in mediating brain damage after ischemic stroke. Recently, Hes1 (hairy and enhancer of split 1) has been implicated in the regulation of ER stress, but whether it plays a functional role after ischemic stroke and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. In this study, using a mouse model of ischemic stroke via transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), we found that Hes1 was induced following brain injury, and that siRNA-mediated knockdown of Hes1 increased the cerebral infarction and worsened the neurological outcome, suggesting that Hes1 knockdown exacerbates ischemic stroke. In addition, mechanistically, Hes1 knockdown promoted apoptosis and activated the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP signaling pathway after tMCAO. These results suggest that Hes1 knockdown promotes ER stress-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of PERK with the specific inhibitor GSK2606414 markedly attenuated the Hes1 knockdown-induced apoptosis and the increased cerebral infarction as well as the worsened neurological outcome following tMCAO, implying that the protection of Hes1 against ischemic stroke is associated with the amelioration of ER stress via modulating the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP signaling pathway. Taken together, these results unveil the detrimental role of Hes1 knockdown after ischemic stroke and further relate it to the regulation of ER stress-induced apoptosis, thus highlighting the importance of targeting ER stress in the treatment of ischemic stroke.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Singapore	31309426	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309426	stroke	7609069906483592026

Alternative methods for service delivery, such as tablet-based speech therapy applications, may help bridge the gap and bring therapeutic interventions to the patient in an engaging way. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an iPad-based speech therapy app that uses automatic speech recognition (ASR) software to provide feedback on speech accuracy to determine the ASR's accuracy against human judgment and whether participants' speech improved with this ASR-based feedback. Method Five participants with apraxia of speech plus aphasia secondary to stroke completed an intensive 4-week at-home therapy program using a novel word training app with built-in ASR. Multiple baselines across participants and behaviors designs were employed, with weekly probes and follow-up at 1 month posttreatment. Four sessions a week of 100 practice trials each were prescribed, with 1 being clinician-run and the remainder done independently. Dependent variables of interest were ASR-human agreement on accuracy during practice trials and human-judged word production accuracy over time in probes. Also, user experience surveys were completed immediately posttreatment. Results ASR-human agreement on accuracy averaged ~80%, which is a common threshold applied for interrater agreement. All participants demonstrated improved word production accuracy over time with the ASR-based feedback and maintenance of gains after 1 month. All participants reported enjoying using the app with support of a speech pathologist. Conclusion For these participants with apraxia of speech plus aphasia due to stroke, satisfactory gains were made in word production accuracy with an app-based therapy program providing ASR-based feedback on accuracy. Findings support further testing of this ASR-based approach as a supplement to clinician-run sessions to assist clients with similar profiles in achieving higher amount and intensity of practice as well as empowering them to manage their own therapy program.

An exploratory study was conducted with CHWs (n = 19) at the regional capitals of Denpasar and Makassar in Indonesia in order to build to a clearer picture of how the participants have integrated personal mobile handsets into their daily professional and personal routine. A communicative ecologies framework was applied to the research design which included a range of qualitative methods including in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and communicative ecology mapping. Our main findings revealed that there was no bottom-up impetus for the introduction of a formal mHealth system to support client interactions. Existing client data collection systems were locked into paper-based systems to ensure compatibility with local government and/or funding body administrative systems; hence, mobile device-based data collection would require additional processes by the participants. Boundary issues were reported with regard to out of hours contact by clients. Some CHWs sent SMS medication reminders to clients but the strong preference indicated by all participating CHWs was to meet clients face-to-face in order to build and maintain trust through the in-person counselling process, rather than introduce mobile-mediated interaction.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314400	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314400	HIV	-5386512752101672374
1817	1817	106	European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology	The use of a poster to reduce expectations to receive antibiotics for a common cold.	"Many doctors prescribe antibiotics for a cold, to meet patient's expectations. As a result, patient's education about antibiotics and antibiotic resistance forms a major component of the WHO's Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance. However, it is not known whether simple educational material can change a person's attitudes about antibiotic therapy. We designed three posters about antibiotic treatment for ""cold and flu"". Hospital inpatients answered a baseline survey and then were asked to look at one of three randomly selected posters. The posters highlighted the futility of antibiotic treatment for colds (futility), the risk of adverse drug reactions from antibiotics (harm), and the issue of antimicrobial resistance (resistance). Participants then completed a follow-up survey. Participants' expectations to receive antibiotics for a ""bad cold"" reduced significantly after viewing a poster (82/299, 27% expected antibiotics in the baseline survey compared with 13% in the follow-up survey, P < 0.01). Continuing expectation to receive antibiotics after viewing one of the posters was associated with expectation to receive antibiotics in the baseline survey and the strong belief that colds were caused by bacteria. Participants who viewed the resistance poster were more likely to continue to expect antibiotics than participants who viewed the futility poster (OR 2.46, 95%CI 1.16-5.20, P = 0.02). Following discussion of the study, viewing a poster reduced participants' expectations to receive antibiotics for a hypothetical cold. Changing patients' expectations to receive antibiotics using simple educational material about antibiotic futility could lead to significant reductions in antibiotic prescription for viral upper respiratory tract infections."	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31102079	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102079	flu	-6126634320182965455

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique, which has been investigated extensively as a potential treatment for stroke. In this study, we wanted to delineate weather the application of tDCS in the subacute stage of recovery post-stroke is superior over the chronic stage. Anodal and sham tDCS was applied to the primary motor cortex of 13 stroke patients in balanced cross-over design during subacute and chronic stages of recovery. The Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function test, evaluating the time required for performance of everyday motor tasks, was employed. The repeated-measure ANOVA showed significant influence of stimulation type, the test performance time relative to stimulation (during or after tDCS) with no overall influence of the stage of recovery. The interaction TYPE*TIME*STAGE was significant. The effect after anodal tDCS in the subacute stage was significantly higher compared to the effects in all relevant conditions including the chronic stage. All responders in this condition were women; six men and one woman did not respond to any stimulation conditions in the subacute stage. tDCS treatment in the subacute stage of recovery can be superior, at least for some patients, over the treatment in the chronic stage.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31314702	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314702	stroke	8224860111193157980

The symptoms of sudden severe headache and/or diminished consciousness characterize the onset of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). However, several studies have suggested that some patients show an atypical presentation at the onset: symptoms lacking sudden headache and diminished consciousness. These atypical symptoms can easily lead to misdiagnosis. This paper reported the death cases of acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage with toothache as the first symptom, hoping to provide clinical evidence for the general public doctors to reduce the misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis of SAH, improve the identification ability of SAH, and prevent such death events from happening again.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31299799	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299799	headache	897043351348716074

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection promotes a generalized activation of host responses that involves not only CD4 T cells, but also cells of the microenvironment, which are not directly infected, such as endothelial cells. The mechanisms triggering HIV-1-associated vascular alterations remain poorly understood. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), implicated in cell-to-cell communication, have been recently described as carriers of microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we show that miR-146b-5p is upregulated in both CD4 T cells, CD4 T cell-derived EVs and circulating EVs obtained from antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV-1-infected patients. We further demonstrate that EVs from T cell line overexpressing miR-146b-5p mimics (miR-146b-EVs): 1) protect their miRNA cargo from RNase degradation, 2) transfer miR-146b-5p mimics into endothelial cells and 3) reduce endothelial inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo in the lungs of mice through the downregulation of nuclear factor-κB-responsive molecules. These data advance our understanding on chronic inflammatory responses affecting endothelial homeostasis, in infectious and non-infectious diseases and pave the way for potential new anti-inflammatory strategies.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31311940	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311940	HIV	-145625979744144572

Pathogen evolution is a potential threat to the long-term benefits provided by public health vaccination campaigns. Mathematical modeling can be a powerful tool to examine the forces responsible for the development of vaccine resistance and to predict its public health implications. We conducted a systematic review of existing literature to understand the construction and application of vaccine resistance models. We identified 26 studies that modeled the public health impact of vaccine resistance for 12 different pathogens. Most models predicted that vaccines would reduce overall disease burden in spite of evolution of vaccine resistance. Relatively few pathogens and populations for which vaccine resistance may be problematic were covered in the reviewed studies, with low- and middle-income countries particularly under-represented. We discuss the key components of model design, as well as patterns of model predictions.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31307874	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307874	vaccine	623421554979899217

A 40-year-old female presented with cough, exertional dyspnea, abdominal pain with distention, fatigue, dry eyes and dry mouth. Past history revealed asthma. Physical examination was normal except for tachypnea. We found leukocytosis, azygos fissure on chest X-ray along with normal pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gases.  Thorax computed tomography (CT) revealed bronchiectasis and ground glass opacities in both lungs. Abdominal CT demonstrated thrombosed proximal splenic artery aneurysm. Further diagnostic procedures were done and according to the positive Schirmer test and compatible histopathologic findings of the salivary gland, diagnosis of primary Sjögren's syndrome was established. Splenic artery aneurysm is rare occurring in less than 1% of the population that usually appears as an incidental finding. This is the first case in literature that introduces Sjögren's syndrome as a risk factor for splenic artery aneurysm. The silent presentation of the splenic artery aneurysm should previse the clinicians that such an occurrence may cause a significant diagnostic dilemma.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Italy	31282141	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31282141	asthma	7616472242818646827

Neurologic involvement of HIV remains an important concern for patients, physicians, and investigators. Catastrophic decline is rarely seen in patients on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART); however, neurological decline remains a critical clinical challenge. In this issue of the JCI, Spudich and associates investigated the status of HIV in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and revealed ongoing presence of HIV in the nervous system. Surprisingly, even in the face of optimal treatment, including suppressed HIV RNA, almost half of the patients investigated showed cell-associated HIV (CA-HIV) DNA in the CSF. Spudich et al. find that persistence of HIV in CSF cells is associated with lower performance on neurocognitive testing. These findings emphasize the need to consider a viral-associated mechanism as playing a significant and potentially ongoing role in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND).	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31305261	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305261	HIV	-1801367878403179328

Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is widely accepted as the most reliable measure of long-term glycemia. However, there is disagreement among professional medical societies on a proper glycemic target for long-term benefits in type 2 diabetes (T2D). The use of some glucose-lowering drugs was associated with heart failure despite substantial lowering of HbA1c. The failure of intensive glycemic control to reduce cardiovascular risk in some trials again brought into question the usefulness of HbA1c as a therapeutic target in T2D. In large cardiovascular outcome trials, some newer glucose-lowering drugs were associated with higher risks of heart failure or amputation despite comparable glycemic control between the test and placebo groups. Here, we provide evidence that variation in hemoglobin glycation between individuals is responsible for these inconsistencies. We suggest that further research be conducted in this area and that the findings be applied to clinical trials and practice.	2019	eng	Review	Japan	31312579	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312579	diabetes	4105873627900556540
1831	1831	32	Veterinary parasitology	The Cryptosporidium parvum gp60 glycoprotein expressed in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila is immunoreactive with sera of calves infected with Cryptosporidium oocysts.	Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite of the phylum Apicomplexa responsible for cryptosporidiosis in calves, a disease that causes significant diarrhea and impairs gain of body weight, generating important production losses. As to now, no effective drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment or prevention of bovine cryptosporidiosis. Several reports suggest that development of a vaccine to prevent cryptosporidiosis is feasible, but relatively few vaccine candidates have been characterized and tested. The most prominent C. parvum antigen is gp60, an O-glycosylated mucin-like protein tethered to the parasite membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Gp60 has been shown to be involved in essential mechanisms for the survival of C. parvum, such as recognition, adhesion to, and invasion of host cells. This work was aimed at expressing gp60 in Tetrahymena thermophila, a ciliated protozoon with numerous advantages for the heterologous expression of eukaryotic proteins, as a first approach for the development of a recombinant vaccine for bovine cryptosporidiosis. T. thermophila-expressed gp60 localized to the protozoon cell surface and oral apparatus, and partitioned into the Triton X-114 detergent phase. This indicates that the protein entered the reticuloendothelial system of the ciliate, and suggests it contains a GPI-anchor. Homogenates of gp60-expressing T. thermophila cells were recognized by sera from calves naturally infected with C. parvum demonstrating their immunoreactivity. In summary, the heterologous expression of gp60, a C. parvum-encoded GPI-anchored protein, has been successfully demonstrated in the ciliate T. thermophila.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31303202	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303202	Diarrhea	-6518848947517153700

Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is an under-utilized Level A evidence-based treatment for migraine prevention. We studied the feasibility and acceptability of smartphone application (app)-based PMR for migraine in a neurology setting, explored whether app-based PMR might reduce headache (HA) days, and examined potential predictors of app and/or PMR use. In this single-arm pilot study, adults with ICHD3 migraine, 4+ HA days/month, a smartphone, and no prior behavioral migraine therapy in the past year were asked to complete a daily HA diary and do PMR for 20 min/day for 90 days. Outcomes were: adherence to PMR (no. and duration of audio plays) and frequency of diary use. Predictors in the models were baseline demographics, HA-specific variables, baseline PROMIS (patient-reported outcomes measurement information system) depression and anxiety scores, presence of overlapping pain conditions studied and app satisfaction scores at time of enrollment. Fifty-one patients enrolled (94% female). Mean age was 39 ± 13 years. The majority (63%) had severe migraine disability at baseline (MIDAS). PMR was played 22 ± 21 days on average. Mean/session duration was 11 ± 7 min. About half (47%) of uses were 1+ time/week and 35% of uses were 2+ times/week. There was a decline in use/week. On average, high users (PMR 2+ days/week in the first month) had 4 fewer days of reported HAs in month 2 vs. month 1, whereas low PMR users (PMR < 2 days/week in the first month) had only 2 fewer HA days in month 2. PROMIS depression score was negatively associated with the log odds of using the diary at least once (vs. no activity) in a week (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = [0.55, 0.85]) and of doing the PMR at least once in a week (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = [0.68, 0.91]). PROMIS anxiety was positively associated with using the diary at least once every week (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = [1.09, 1.73]) and with doing the PMR at least once every week (OR = 1.14 [95% CI = [1.02, 1.31]). In conclusion, about half of participants used smartphone-based PMR intervention based upon a brief, initial introduction to the app. App use was associated with reduction in HA days. Higher depression scores were negatively associated with diary and PMR use, whereas higher anxiety scores were positively associated.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31304392	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304392	headache	4706890430832287959

Skin prick tests (SPT) represent a major tool for diagnosing IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. When improperly performed, SPT can lead to false-positive (FP) or false-negative results. Contamination of the instrument by another allergen extract, when using a single device whiped between tests, is known to induce FP results. Our study was conducted in order to establish the prevalence of FP when using the same SPT tool wiped between SPT, performed with four different devices. We further searched for the risk factors of eliciting a FP result and analyzed the possible correlation between the diameters of subsequent SPT results. Patients with rhinitis and/or asthma to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) or Grass Pollens were studied. Skin prick tests were performed by two trained investigators, with the 23 G needle, Stallergenes Greer Lancet, ALK Lancet and Stallerpoint®, respectively. The device was wiped between each test either with dry cotton wool or with cotton wool moistened in 75% alcohol. Allergen solution and negative controls (negCTRL) were used in two different sequences (allergen followed by five negative controls or allergen and negative control used alternately). Thirty-six patients sensitized to Der p (51.4%) and thirty-four patients sensitized to Grass Pollens (48.6%) were studied. Whatever the device used, between 50 and 66.6% of patients presented at least one FP result to the first SPT with a negCTRL, following an allergen SPT and up to 6% of patients when pricking down to the fifth negCTRL. No unique risk factor for FP results with the four devices was found. Correlations between the diameters of the reactions at SPT site (whether with the allergen or negCTRL) were mostly weak to moderate (ρ<0.5). Using the same 23G Needle, Stallergenes Greer Lancet, ALK Lancet and Stallerpoint® for performing several consecutive SPT is significantly associated with an unacceptable rate of FP results.

1836	1836	124	Mayo Clinic proceedings	Ulcerative Colitis.	Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can involve any aspect of the colon starting with mucosal inflammation in the rectum and extending proximally in a continuous fashion. Typical symptoms on presentation are bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, fecal urgency, and tenesmus. In some patients, extraintestinal manifestations may predate the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms. A diagnosis of UC is made on the basis of presenting symptoms consistent with UC as well as endoscopic evidence showing continuous and diffuse colonic inflammation that starts in the rectum. Biopsies of the colon documenting chronic inflammation confirm the diagnosis of UC. Most cases are treated with pharmacological therapy to first induce remission and then to maintain a corticosteroid-free remission. There are multiple classes of drugs used to treat the disease. For mild to moderate UC, oral and rectal 5-aminosalycilates are typically used. In moderate to severe colitis, medication classes include thiopurines, biological agents targeting tumor necrosis factor and integrins, and the small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitors. However, in up to 15% of cases, patients in whom medical therapy fails or who have development of dysplasia secondary to their long-standing colitis will require surgical treatment. Finally, to minimize the complications of UC and adverse events from medications, a working collaboration between primary care physicians and gastroenterologists is necessary to make sure that vaccinations are optimized and that patients are screened for colon cancer, skin cancer, bone loss, depression, and other treatable and preventable complications.	2019	eng	Review	England	31272578	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31272578	Diarrhea	5314107418764884230

And within that state, the 38 counties comprising South Texas--a highly populated, largely Hispanic area characterized by high uninsured rates and low numbers of health care providers--are emblematic of nationwide crises in public health. The South Texas Health Status Review: A Health Disparities Roadmap brings health care disparities to light in instructive detail. Over thirty key health conditions and risk factors, such as breast cancer, diabetes, obesity, tuberculosis, smoking and alcohol use, lead exposure, birth defects, and homicide rates, are analyzed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and location (urban or rural), and the results compared with the rest of Texas and the nation as a whole. A section on conclusions and recommendations outlines factors contributing to these conditions and offers suggestions for improvement. These important data should stimulate further population studies and provide impetus for targeted public health interventions and community outreach programs to reduce health inequities and advance care access in the state and the U.S. at large. Major health issues covered in the report include: • Communicable diseases • Cancer incidence and mortality • Maternal and child health • Chronic diseases • Behavioral risk factors in adults • Environmental health issues • Suicide, homicide, and vehicular mortality. The South Texas Health Status Review contains valuable lessons for researchers in health promotion and health disparities, as well as community health professionals. Policymakers involved in reducing health disparities will find it especially useful.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314218	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314218	cancer	8749720044741011597

Calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide broadly distributed in neuronal and non-neuronal regions throughout the body, plays a fundamental role in migraine and cluster headache (CH) pathophysiology. CGRP functional blockade alleviates neurogenic inflammation and reduces pain pathway sensitization. Two types of CGRP function-blocking modalities, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), and small molecules (gepants), have been designed to target the CGRP ligands and CGRP receptors. In this narrative review, we summarized the latest clinical trials on gepants and CGRP function-blocking MAbs for migraine and CH prevention. At the time of writing, newer gepants are currently under Federal Drug Administration (FDA) review for migraine management, but there is no study yet on the usage of gepants for CH. Erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab have been approved by the FDA for migraine prevention while eptinezumab is under FDA review. CGRP MAbs are as effective as and more tolerable than conventional migraine preventives. For CH prevention, galcanezumab has shown some promising findings and was recently approved for use in episodic cluster prevention.

1842	1842	3	 	Life Course Research Agenda (LCRA), Version 1.0	Life course health science research is “connecting the dots” between child health development, adult patterns of premature morbidity and mortality, and more integrated notions of healthy aging. However, there are still many outstanding questions about the relationship between early experiences and lifelong health and well-being, as well as a growing need to understand how emerging knowledge can be applied to the development of evidence-based practice and policy that can reduce risks, minimize exposures, and optimize lifelong health. In 2010, the Maternal and Child Health Life Course Research Network (LCRN) initiated an inclusive research agenda-setting process that resulted in the Handbook of Life Course Health Development, which offers state-of-the-art reviews and analyses of life course health-development (LCHD) research focused on key life stages and a variety of health conditions, as well as recommendations pertaining to future research in these areas. In developing this concluding chapter and the research agenda it contains, we have attempted to synthesize the authors’ findings and recommendations in order to propose a more integrated set of research priorities and strategies that can advance the entire LCHD field. The resulting transdisciplinary research agenda focuses on foundational research, including research that addresses life course epidemiology, research that elucidates LCHD processes (e.g., sensitive periods, epigenetics), and research that identifies effective interventions, with a special emphasis on health disparities research and research on high priority conditions (e.g., obesity and mental health conditions) and specific vulnerable populations (e.g., children in foster care, premature infants, and children with medical complexity). It also considers essential research capacity-building activities focused on data, data systems, and methods, as well as strategies for building the human, technical, cultural, and financial capacity required to carry out this challenging work. Lastly, it addresses the importance of translational and intervention research that can speed the application of concepts and findings to the practice and policy arenas. We conclude with a discussion of advancing the overall LCHD research paradigm, including the framework and principles that have emerged from the research thus far and that are helping to define a robust explanatory and theoretical LCHD framework.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314297	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314297	aging	-7726397374158219907

1846	1846	88	Journal of cellular physiology	A loop involving NRF2, miR-29b-1-5p and AKT, regulates cell fate of MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells.	The present study shows that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and miR-29b-1-5p are two opposite forces which could regulate the fate of MDA-MB-231 cells, the most studied triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line. We show that NRF2 activation stimulates cell growth and markedly reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, whereas miR-29b-1-5p overexpression increases ROS generation and reduces cell proliferation. Moreover, NRF2 downregulates miR-29b-1-5p expression, whereas miR-29b-1-5p overexpression decreases p-AKT and p-NRF2. Furthermore, miR-29b-1-5p overexpression induces both inhibition of DNA N-methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B) expression and re-expression of HIN1, RASSF1A and CCND2. Conversely, NRF2 activation induces opposite effects. We also show that parthenolide, a naturally occurring small molecule, induces the expression of miR-29b-1-5p which could suppress NRF2 activation via AKT inhibition. Overall, this study uncovers a novel NRF2/miR-29b-1-5p/AKT regulatory loop that can regulate the fate (life/death) of MDA-MB-231 cells and suggests this loop as therapeutic target for TNBC.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31313842	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313842	cancer	-360529647164834348

Infections due to rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM), and in particular the RGM species Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab), are very difficult to treat and reports on novel therapeutic options are scarce. A hallmark of all pathogenic RGM species is their resistance to the four first-line drugs used to treat infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis including rifampicin. This study demonstrates that modification of the rifampicin scaffold can restore rifampicin activity against the three most commonly isolated pathogenic RGM species including Mab. We also note that the structure-activity relationship for Mab is different as compared to the non-pathogenic RGM species Mycobacterium smegmatis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31281018	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31281018	tuberculosis	1881534532776527237
1853	1853	742	Medicine	Obesity in psoriatic arthritis: Comparative prevalence and associated factors.	Obesity is a common cardiovascular risk factor in psoriatic disease. Although the prevalence of obesity is high, the factors associated with it in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are poorly understood. We aimed to analyze the frequency and obesity-associated factors in a cohort of PsA.This retrospective cross-sectional study included 290 consecutive patients with PsA according to CASPAR criteria. Three-hundred ten psoriatic patients without arthritis and 600 outpatients without inflammatory conditions were used as comparison populations. The factors associated with obesity were analyzed first using conditional logistic regression. The significant factors in this first model were introduced in a multivariate model using a backward step approach.This series included 159 men (54.8%) and 131 women (45.2%), with an average age of 54 ± 12 years. Obesity was more common both in psoriasis (36.5% vs 22%, OR 2.1 [95%CI: 1.5-2.8), P < .01]) and PsA (27.6% vs 22%, OR 1.4 [95%CI: 1.0-1.9], P < .05) than in the non-inflammatory population. Obesity was more frequent in psoriasis (36.5%) than in PsA (27.6%), OR 1.5 95% CI: 1.1 to 2.1, P < .05. After correcting for age, sex, disease duration, and other confounders, independent associations with obesity (P < .05) were: PsA family history (OR 3.6, 95%CI: 1.1-12.4), evolution as axial disease (OR 4.4, 95%CI: 1.0-15.4), and dyslipidemia (OR 3.5, 95%CI: 1.5-8.6).Obesity is common in psoriatic disease, but much more frequent among patients with cutaneous than joint disease. Patients who present with spondylitis during evolution are more prone to this comorbidity, and therefore, should be closely monitored to correct this eventuality in a timely manner.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31305449	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305449	obesity	8119274153437896343

Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading killer caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Recently, anti-TB peptides have provided an alternative approach to combat antibiotic tolerance. We have developed an effective computational predictor, iAntiTB (Identification of Anti-tubercular Peptides), by the integration of multiple feature vectors deriving from the amino acid sequences via random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The iAntiTB combines the RF and SVM scores via linear regression to enhance the prediction accuracy. To make a robust and accurate predictor, we prepared the two datasets with different types of negative samples. The iAntiTB achieved AUC values of 0.896 and 0.946 on the training datasets of the first and second datasets, respectively. The iAntiTB outperformed the other existing predictors.

Nebivolol is a novel β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) blocker with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The NLRP3 inflammasome plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced vascular dysfunction. Our study aimed to explore the effect of nebivolol on the NLRP3 inflammasome and vascular remodelling in diet-induced obese rats. Eight-week-old Sprague-Dawley male rats were fed with either a standard chow diet (ND) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks. Next, the obese rats were subdivided into three groups as follows: 1) HFD control group; 2) HFD with low doses of nebivolol (5 mg /kg/d); and 3) HFD with high doses of nebivolol (10 mg/kg/d). A four-week treatment with nebivolol improved acetylcholine-induced vascular relaxation in accordance with an increased aortic endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Nebivolol enhanced the levels of phase II detoxifying enzymes, including superoxide dismutase and catalase. In parallel, nebivolol attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and suppressed autophagy. These effects were associated with an increased β3-AR level. Moreover, nebivolol treatment significantly increased of AMP-activated protein kinase activity and decreased of phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin. These results demonstrated that nebivolol improves obesity-induced vascular remodelling by attenuating NLRP3 inflammasome activation and restoring the antioxidant defence.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31306372	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306372	obesity	4345055131254210605
1859	1859	408	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	Diagnosis and Treatment of Alcohol-Related Liver Diseases: 2019 Practice Guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.	"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) represents a spectrum of liver injury resulting from alcohol use, ranging from hepatic steatosis to more advanced forms including alcoholic hepatitis (AH), alcoholic cirrhosis (AC), and acute alcoholic hepatitis presenting as acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). ALD is a major cause of liver disease worldwide, both on its own and as a co-factor in the progression of chronic viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), iron overload and other liver diseases. ALD develops through several stages, beginning with hepatic steatosis, and, in some individuals, gradually progressing through alcoholic hepatitis (the histological correlate of which is alcoholic steatohepatitis), culminating in cirrhosis (Figure 1). Progression through these various stages is dependent upon continued heavy alcohol consumption and other risk factors, including female sex, genetic susceptibility, diet, and comorbid liver disease. ALD carries a significant stigma in society. It is increasingly recognized by providers that patients and their families seek to reduce the stigma of alcoholic liver disease, and a change from the term ""alcoholic"" to ""alcohol-related"" will help; thus, alcohol-related liver disease, alcohol-related steatohepatitis, and alcohol-related cirrhosis are suggested, retaining the familiar abbreviations (ALD, ASH, and AC, respectively). Due to longstanding usage, the term alcoholic hepatitis (AH) will likely persist. This article is protected by copyright.

People classified as ultra-high risk (UHR) of developing psychosis have reduced cellular membrane omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). We aimed to compare omega-3 index, fatty acids and molecular phospholipid species from erythrocytes of people with UHR (n = 285) with age-matched healthy controls (n = 120) assessed by mass spectrometry. Lower proportions of PUFA were observed in the UHR group compared to healthy controls; specifically, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was 29.3% lower, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was 27.2% lower, arachidonic acid (AA) was 15.8% lower and the omega-3 index was 26.9% lower. The AA to EPA ratio was higher in the UHR group compared to the healthy group. Smoking status had no significant effect on PUFA levels in healthy or the UHR groups. BMI was associated with PUFA levels in the UHR group only and the statistical model only explains 2% of the variance of the PUFA levels. The proportion of nervonic acid was 64.4% higher in the UHR group compared to healthy controls. At a lipid class level, the UHR group had 16% higher concentrations of sphingomyelin (SM) and 46% lower concentrations phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) compared to healthy group. Of the 49 individual molecular phospholipids, twenty-seven phospholipid species were lower in the UHR group. In conclusion, there are clear differences in the proportions of erythrocyte fatty acids and phospholipids between UHR and healthy controls and UHR had higher concentrations of SM and lower concentrations of PE. These differences may represent a promising prodromal risk biomarker in the UHR population to aid clinical diagnosis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31301881	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301881	smoking	-1683903891018782242

Certain perceptual measures have been proposed as indirect assays of brain neurochemical status in people with migraine. One such measure is binocular rivalry, however, previous studies have not measured rivalry characteristics and brain neurochemistry together in people with migraine. This study compared spectroscopy-measured levels of GABA and Glx (glutamine and glutamate complex) in visual cortex between 16 people with migraine and 16 non-headache controls, and assessed whether the concentration of these neurochemicals explains, at least partially, inter-individual variability in binocular rivalry perceptual measures. Mean Glx level was significantly reduced in migraineurs relative to controls, whereas mean occipital GABA levels were similar between groups. Neither GABA levels, nor Glx levels correlated with rivalry percept duration. Our results thus suggest that the previously suggested relationship between rivalry percept duration and GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmitter concentration in visual cortex is not strong enough to enable rivalry percept duration to be reliably assumed to be a surrogate for GABA concentration, at least in the context of healthy individuals and those that experience migraine.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31291247	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291247	headache	-8968101771604200516

1869	1869	478	Microbes and infection	The remarkable history of the hepatitis C virus.	The infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an example of the translational research success. The reciprocal interactions between clinicians and scientists have allowed in 30 years the initiation of empirical treatments by interferon, the discovery of the virus, the development of serological and virological tools for diagnosis but also for prognosis (the non-invasive biochemical or morphological fibrosis tests, the predictors of the specific immune response including genetic IL28B polymorphisms). Finally, well-tolerated and effective treatments with oral antivirals inhibiting HCV non-structural viral proteins involved in viral replication have been marketed this last decade, allowing the cure of all infected subjects. HCV chronic infection, which is a public health issue, is a hepatic disease which may lead to a cirrhosis and an hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but also a systemic disease with extra-hepatic manifestations either associated with a cryoglobulinemic vasculitis or chronic inflammation. The HCV infection is the only chronic viral infection which may be cured: the so-called sustained virologic response, defined by undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after the end of the treatment, significantly reduces the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with hepatic and extra-hepatic manifestations which are mainly reversible. The history of HCV ends with the pangenotypic efficacy of the multiple combinations, easy to use for 8 to 12 weeks with one to three pills per day and little problems of tolerance. This explains the short 30 years from the virus discovery to the viral hepatitis elimination policy proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016.	2019	eng	Journal Article	France	31295571	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295571	Cirrhosis	4695698299220703541

Tuberculosis is a disease caused by tubercle bacillus infection. It can affect all of the body's organs. Pulmonary tuberculosis accounts for a little more than 50% of its occurrences. It is a public health problem worldwide, and developing countries in particular. Pseudotumoral bronchopulmonary tuberculosis is a particular form of tuberculosis in immunocompetent subject. It can manifests as a bronchial or pulmonary lesion, suggesting a neoplasia visible on chest CT scan or bronchoscopy. This similarity can confuse clinicians, making diagnosis challenging and requiring the use of invasive diagnostic techniques, since traditional means are often lacking. This increases burden of care and causes delayed treatment. This study aims to educate clinicians about this particular and uncommon form of tuberculosis, which should be suspected in patient with radiological findings compatible with the disease, especially since they live in a highly endemic country. Therapy and treatment duration are the same as for common forms of tuberculosis.	2019	fre	English Abstract	Uganda	31303939	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303939	tuberculosis	2244894675266276573

Herein we report the screening of a small library of aurones and their isosteric counterparts, azaaurones and N-acetylazaaurones, against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Aurones were inactive at 20 µM, while azaurones and N-acetylazaaurones emerged as the most potent compounds, with nine derivatives displaying MIC99 values ranging from 0.4 to 2.0 μM. In addition, several N-acetylazaaurones were found to be active against multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) clinical M. tuberculosis isolates. The anti-mycobacterial mechanism of action of these compounds remains to be determined, however a preliminary mechanistic study confirmed that they do not inhibit the mycobacterial cytochrome bc1 complex. Additionally, microsomal metabolic stability and metabolite identification studies revealed that N-acetylazaaurones are deacetylated to their azaaurone counterparts. Overall, these results demonstrate that azaaurones and their N-acetyl counterparts represent a new entry in the toolbox of chemotypes capable of inhibiting M. tuberculosis growth.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31294529	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31294529	tuberculosis	-339230353302835829

The retrovirus HIV-1 has been a major health issue since its discovery in the early 80s. In 2017, over 37 million people were infected with HIV-1, of which 1.8 million were new infections that year. Currently, the most successful treatment regimen is the highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), which consists of a combination of three to four of the current 26 FDA-approved HIV-1 drugs. Half of these drugs target the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme that is essential for viral replication. One class of RT inhibitors are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), a crucial component of the HAART therapy. Once incorporated into DNA, NRTIs function as a chain terminator to stop viral DNA replication. Unfortunately, treatment with NRTIs is sometimes linked to toxicity caused by off-target side effects. NRTIs may also target the replicative human mitochondrial DNA polymerase (Pol γ), causing long-term severe drug toxicity. The goal of this work is to understand the discrimination mechanism of different NRTI analogs by RT. Crystal structures and kinetic experiments are essential for the rational design of new molecules that are able to bind selectively to RT and not Pol γ. Structural comparison of NRTI-binding modes with both RT and Pol γ enzymes highlights key amino acids that are responsible for the difference in affinity of these drugs to their targets. Therefore, the long-term goal of this research is to develop safer, next generation therapeutics that can overcome off-target toxicity. This article is protected by copyright.

The significance of flu prediction is that the appropriate preventive and control measures can be taken by relevant departments after assessing predicted data; thus, morbidity and mortality can be reduced. In this paper, three flu prediction models, based on twitter and US Centers for Disease Control's (CDC's) Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) data, are proposed (models 1-3) to verify the factors that affect the spread of the flu. In this work, an Improved Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to optimize the parameters of Support Vector Regression (IPSO-SVR) was proposed. The IPSO-SVR was trained by the independent and dependent variables of the three models (models 1-3) as input and output. The trained IPSO-SVR method was used to predict the regional unweighted percentage ILI (%ILI) events in the US. The prediction results of each model are analyzed and compared. The results show that the IPSO-SVR method (model 3) demonstrates excellent performance in real-time prediction of ILIs, and further highlights the benefits of using real-time twitter data, thus providing an effective means for the prevention and control of flu.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31013324	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31013324	flu	-8254222281357012124

The burden of cardiovascular disease and death in chronic kidney disease (CKD) outpaces that of the other diseases and is not adequately described by traditional risk factors alone. Diminished activity of paraoxonase (PON)-1 is associated with increased oxidant stress, a common feature underlying the pathogenesis of CKD. We aimed to assess the prognostic value of circulating PON-1 protein and PON lactonase activity on adverse clinical outcomes across various stages and etiologies of CKD. Circulating PON-1 protein levels and PON lactonase activity were measured simultaneously in patients with CKD as well as a cohort of apparently healthy non-CKD subjects. Both circulating PON-1 protein levels and PON lactonase activity were significantly lower in CKD patients compared to the non-CKD subjects. Similarly, across all stages of CKD, circulating PON-1 protein and PON lactonase activity were significantly lower in patients with CKD compared to the non-CKD controls. Circulating PON lactonase activity, but not protein levels, predicted future adverse clinical outcomes, even after adjustment for traditional risk factors. The combination of lower circulating protein levels and higher activity within the CKD subjects were associated with the best survival outcomes. These findings demonstrate that diminished circulating PON lactonase activity, but not protein levels, predicts higher risk of future adverse clinical outcomes in patients with CKD.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31311140	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311140	stress	-7564569805639737618

Chronic arsenic (As) exposure is a major environmental threat to human health affecting >100 million people worldwide. Low blood selenium (Se) increases the risk of As-induced health problems. Our aim was to reduce As toxicity through a naturally Se-rich lentil diet. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-control trial in Bangladesh, 405 participants chronically exposed to As were enrolled. The intervention arm (Se-group) consumed Se-rich lentils (55 μg Se/day); the control arm received lentils of similar nutrient profile except with low Se (1.5 μg Se/day). Anthropometric measurements, blood, urine and stool samples, were taken at baseline, 3 and 6 months; hair at baseline and 6 months after intervention. Morbidity data were collected fortnightly. Measurements included total As in all biological samples, As metabolites in urine, and total Se in blood and urine. Intervention with Se-rich lentils resulted in higher urinary As excretion (p = 0.001); increased body mass index (p ≤ 0.01), and lower incidence of asthma (p = 0.05) and allergy (p = 0.02) compared to the control group. The Se-group demonstrated increased excretion of urinary As metabolite, dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) at 6 months compared to control group (p = 0.008). Consuming Se-rich lentils can increase As excretion and improve the health indicators in the presence of continued As exposure.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31299617	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299617	asthma	5293701842202310496

1907	1907	122	Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)	The Role of Zinc in Antiviral Immunity.	Zinc is an essential trace element that is crucial for growth, development, and the maintenance of immune function. Its influence reaches all organs and cell types, representing an integral component of approximately 10% of the human proteome, and encompassing hundreds of key enzymes and transcription factors. Zinc deficiency is strikingly common, affecting up to a quarter of the population in developing countries, but also affecting distinct populations in the developed world as a result of lifestyle, age, and disease-mediated factors. Consequently, zinc status is a critical factor that can influence antiviral immunity, particularly as zinc-deficient populations are often most at risk of acquiring viral infections such as HIV or hepatitis C virus. This review summarizes current basic science and clinical evidence examining zinc as a direct antiviral, as well as a stimulant of antiviral immunity. An abundance of evidence has accumulated over the past 50 y to demonstrate the antiviral activity of zinc against a variety of viruses, and via numerous mechanisms. The therapeutic use of zinc for viral infections such as herpes simplex virus and the common cold has stemmed from these findings; however, there remains much to be learned regarding the antiviral mechanisms and clinical benefit of zinc supplementation as a preventative and therapeutic treatment for viral infections.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31305906	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305906	HIV	6987372590141903729

Tau tangles are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) with strong correlations existing between tau aggregation and cognitive decline. Studies in mouse models have shown that the characteristic patterns of tau spatial spread associated with AD progression are determined by neural connectivity rather than physical proximity between different brain regions. We present here a network diffusion model for tau aggregation based on longitudinal tau measures from positron emission tomography (PET) and structural connectivity graphs from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). White matter fiber bundles reconstructed via tractography from the DTI data were used to compute normalized graph Laplacians which served as graph diffusion kernels for tau spread. By linearizing this model and using sparse source localization, we were able to identify distinct patterns of propagative and generative buildup of tau at a population level. A gradient descent approach was used to solve the sparsity-constrained optimization problem. Model fitting was performed on subjects from the Harvard Aging Brain Study cohort. The fitted model parameters include a scalar factor controlling the network-based tau spread and a network-independent seed vector representing seeding in different regions-of-interest. This parametric model was validated on an independent group of subjects from the same cohort. We were able to predict with reasonably high accuracy the tau buildup at a future time-point. The network diffusion model, therefore, successfully identifies two distinct mechanisms for tau buildup in the aging brain and offers a macroscopic perspective on tau spread.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31156312	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31156312	Alzheimer	-8942026248671582808

"Large-scale structural interventions and ""Big Events"" like revolutions, wars and major disasters can affect HIV transmission by changing the sizes of at-risk populations, making high-risk behaviors more or less likely, or changing contexts in which risk occurs. This paper describes new measures to investigate hypothesized pathways that could connect macro-social changes to subsequent HIV transmission. We developed a ""menu"" of novel scales and indexes on topics including norms about sex and drug injecting under different conditions, experiencing denial of dignity, agreement with cultural themes about what actions are needed for survival or resistance, solidarity and other issues. We interviewed 298 at-risk heterosexuals and 256 men who have sex with men in New York City about these measures and possible validators for them. Most measures showed evidence of criterion validity (absolute magnitude of Pearson's r ≥ 0.20) and reliability (Cronbach's alpha ≥ 0.70). These measures can be (cautiously) used to understand how macro-changes affect HIV and other risk. Many can also be used to understand risk contexts and dynamics in more normal situations. Additional efforts to improve and to replicate the validation of these measures should be conducted."	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313092	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313092	HIV	3134511142783292503

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) adversely affects neurological recovery. This study aimed to determine the impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and/or rehabilitation in basal ganglia stroke patients with OSA.A prospective controlled trial was conducted in 2015-2018. The subjects received routine rehabilitation training for up to 2 years and were assigned to the intervention and control groups treated with CPAP or without, respectively. Then, treatment effects on sleep parameters, motor function, stroke severity, daily life activities, cognitive function, and psychological states were assessed at different time points.At 6 months, the CPAP group showed significantly lower mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), percentage of time with SpO2 at <90% (TS90%), micro-arousal index, and percentages of time in non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) stages 1-2 and REM stage in total sleeping time compared with the control group, and significantly higher mean minimum of peripheral oxygen saturation (L-SaO2%) and percentage of time in stage 3 (P < .001) sleep. The CPAP group showed significant improvements in average the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Fugl-Meyer assessment scale (FMA), Barthel index (BI), Minimental state examination (MMSE), Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) and Hamilton depression rating scale for depression (HRSD) scores at different times versus the control group, respectively (P < .05). However, no difference in body mass index (BMI) management was observed (P > .05). Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed significant interactions between the two groups for change in FMA, MMSE, BI, HAMA, and HRSD scores from admission to 24 months (P < .001), but no significant was found for BMI (P = .582).Basal ganglia stroke patients with OSA tend to have significantly greater sleeping, neurological and functional recovery after CPAP, and rehabilitation over 2 years.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31305423	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305423	depression	1920899299418335515

Clinical studies have demonstrated that cigarette smoking is strongly associated with insulin resistance and heart disease. Nicotine is considered the primary toxin constituent associated with smoking. However, the distinct molecular mechanism of nicotine-induced cardiac dysfunction remains unclear. Cardiomyocytes with nicotine-induced insulin resistance are characterized by decreased glucose uptake, as measured by 2-[N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-NBDG), a fluorescent derivative of glucose, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Immunoblotting was used to evaluate the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K, p85, Y607). We determined the impact of nicotine on insulin resistance and Nrf2, phospho-ERK and phospho-PI3K expression in the myocardial tissue of a mouse model. Nicotine increased ROS production and depressed insulin-induced glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, reversed nicotine-inhibited glucose uptake induced by insulin. Nicotine exposure directly inhibited Nrf2 and increased ERK phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes, which were obstructed by NAC. Further exploration of signaling cascades revealed nicotine-induced ROS involved in inhibiting PI3K/Nrf2 and activating ERK in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, the mouse model treated with nicotine showed glucose intolerance and impaired insulin tolerance accompanied by inhibited PI3K/Nrf2 and increased ERK in myocardial tissues. Thus, nicotine induces insulin resistance via the downregulation of Nrf2 activity in cardiomyocytes, which is a potential mechanism of the pharmacological effects of nicotine. This study identified potential therapeutic targets against nicotine-related cardiovascular diseases.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Ireland	31315024	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315024	stress	7532891417681708371

Nanomedicine is a multidisciplinary research field with an integration of traditional sciences such as chemistry, physics, biology and materials science. The application of nanomedicine for lung diseases as a relatively new area of interdisciplinary science has grown rapidly over the last 10 years. Promising research outcomes suggest that nanomedicine will revolutionise the practice of medicine, through the development of new approaches in therapeutic agent delivery, vaccine development and nanotechnology-based medical detections. Nano-based approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases will, in the not too distant future, change the way we practise medicine. This review will focus on the current trends and developments in the clinical translation of nanomedicine for lung diseases, such as in the areas of lung cancer, cystic fibrosis, asthma, bacterial infections and COPD.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31285360	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285360	asthma	8710192305140953186
1917	1917	194	Pediatric transplantation	Telomere length regulators are activated in young men after pediatric kidney transplantation compared to healthy controls and survivors of childhood cancer-A cross-sectional study.	Chronic diseases are known to cause premature aging and frailty. Data about telomere length and telomere length-regulating proteins after pediatric KTx are scarce. Leukocyte telomere length and gene expression level of eight telomere-binding proteins were analyzed in 20 KTx recipients, eight childhood NBL survivors, and nine healthy controls. The influence of key clinical parameters on telomere length and on regulators of telomere length was evaluated. The telomere length in the KTx recipients tended to be shorter (0.53 AU) than in the healthy controls (0.64 AU) but longer than in the NBL survivors (0.38 AU). There was no significant difference in telomere length between the NBL survivors and the KTx recipients (P = .110). The gene expression level of telomere length-preserving protein RPA1 was significantly higher in the KTx recipients than among the NBL survivors or healthy controls, while the expression of TRF2 and the tumor suppressor gene p16 was significantly higher in the KTX recipients when compared to the controls. TRF2 and TIN2 correlated significantly with hsCRP; additionally, TRF2 showed significant correlation with plasma creatinine and eGFR. KTx recipients have near to normal telomere length, but they have significantly higher gene expression levels of telomere regulatory proteins compared with healthy controls, suggesting activation of mechanisms preserving telomere length among KTx recipients. Our results suggest that declined graft function and consequent inflammatory response may have influence on telomerase activity.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Denmark	31297925	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297925	aging	-2879657397552025078

1919	1919	56	Psychoneuroendocrinology	Allostatic load in the association of depressive symptoms with incident coronary heart disease: The Jackson Heart Study.	African Americans are at heightened risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), with biologic pathways poorly understood. We examined the role of allostatic load (AL) in the association of depressive symptoms with incident CHD among 2,670 African American men and women in the prospective Jackson Heart Study. Depressive symptoms were quantified using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Incident CHD was ascertained by self-report, death certificate survey, and adjudicated medical record surveillance. Baseline AL was quantified using biologic parameters of metabolic, cardiovascular, immune, and neuroendocrine subsystems and as a combined meta-factor. Sequential models adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral covariates, stratified to examine differences by sex. Greater depressive symptomatology was associated with greater metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune AL (p-values≤0.036) and AL meta-factor z-scores (p = 0.007), with findings driven by observations among females. Each 1-point increase in baseline depressive symptomatology, and 1-SD increase in metabolic AL, neuroendocrine AL, and AL meta-factor z-scores was associated with 3.3%, 88%, 39%, and 130% increases in CHD risk, respectively (p-values <0.001). Neuroendocrine AL and AL meta-factor scores predicted incident CHD among males but not females in stratified analyses. Metabolic AL partially mediated the association of depressive symptoms with incident CHD (5.79% mediation, p = 0.044), a finding present among females (p = 0.016) but not males (p = 0.840). Among African American adults, we present novel findings of an association between depressive symptomatology and incident CHD, partially mediated by metabolic AL. These findings appear to be unique to females, an important consideration in the design of targeted interventions for CHD prevention.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31307010	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307010	heart+disease	-3488100191290830083

We investigated the incidence of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among people with COPD and whether exposure to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and exacerbation status was associated with T2DM. This descriptive cohort study used primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The patient cohort included people with a diagnosis of COPD and previous smoking history registered at a CPRD practice between January 2010 and December 2016. We determined incidence rates by age, gender and deprivation. Using a nested case-control design-where cases and controls are drawn from the cohort population-we matched 1:5 with patients by age, gender and GP practice and estimated odds of T2DM using logistic regression (adjusting for smoking status, deprivation, BMI, hypertension, coronary heart disease and heart failure). We identified 220,971 COPD patients; mean age at COPD diagnosis was 66 years (SD 12) and 54% were male. The incidence rate of T2DM in COPD patients was 1.26 per 100 patient years (95% CI: 1.24-1.28) and was higher among men (1.32 vs 1.18 among women). The adjusted odds ratio for T2DM was 1.47 (95% CI: 1.36-1.60) among frequent exacerbators (≥2 treated exacerbations per year) compared to infrequent exacerbators and the odds ratio for patients receiving high-dose ICS (>800 mcg budesonide equivalent dose) was 1.73 (95% CI 1.65-1.82) compared to patients receiving no ICS therapy. Incidence of T2DM among COPD patients is high and exposure to ICS and frequent exacerbations are associated with a higher risk of T2DM among patients with COPD.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31308364	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308364	smoking	-498521148402713730

Patients hospitalized for asthma can exhibit concurrent cardiac symptoms and undergo cardiac work up. We identify patients admitted for asthma that underwent cardiac workup and describe outcomes to evaluate the utility of cardiac testing in this population. Patients aged 4 to 17 years admitted for status asthmaticus from 2012 - 2016 were screened for EKG, ECHO, or cardiac enzyme obtainment. Out of 1296 patients, 77 (6%) received cardiac testing. The most common reasons for testing were chest pain (25, 32%), blood pressure abnormalities (11, 14%), tachycardia (8, 10%), arrhythmia (6, 8%), and syncope (6, 8%). Sinus tachycardia (43, 66%) was the most common EKG finding. 4 out of 27 patients who underwent ECHOs had abnormalities: 2 with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), 1 with vascular ring, and 1 with evidence of pulmonary hypertension. All patients who underwent an EKG to evaluate tachycardia had normalization of heart rate at discharge. Cardiac ischemia was not evident in any patients who underwent workup with cardiac enzymes to evaluate chest pain. All cases of arrhythmias resolved on discharge. Diastolic hypotension (DhTN) was found in 10 out of the 11 blood pressure abnormalities. There was mixed efficacy of fluid bolus in correcting DhTN. All DhTN resolved on discharge. One patient with syncope had a new diagnosis of HCM. While cardiac complications are seen in patients admitted for status asthmaticus, the etiology rarely stems from underlying cardiac disease. EKGs, ECHOs, and cardiac enzymes should have a minimal role in the management of the hospitalized asthmatic patient.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31288567	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31288567	asthma	-5679515279292214033
1923	1923	191	Tropical medicine and infectious disease	Evaluation of a Virus Neutralisation Test for Detection of Rift Valley Fever Antibodies in Suid Sera.	Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a vector-borne viral disease of ruminants mainly, and man, characterized by abortions and neonatal deaths in animals and flu-like to more severe symptoms that can result in death in humans. The disease is endemic in Africa, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and outbreaks occur following proliferation of RVF virus (RVFV) infected mosquito vectors. Vertebrate animal maintenance hosts of RVFV, which serve as a source of virus during inter-epidemic periods remain unknown, with wild and domestic suids being largely overlooked. To address this, we evaluated the virus neutralization test (VNT) for RVF antibody detection in suid sera, as a first step in assessing the role of suids in the epidemiology of RVF in Africa. Testing of experimental and field sera from domestic pigs and warthogs with a commercial RVF competitive antibody ELISA, served as a reference standard against which the VNT results were compared. Results indicate that VNT can detect anti-RVFV antibodies within three days post-infection, has an analytical specificity of 100% and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 97%, respectively. Although labour-intensive and time-consuming, the VNT proved suitable for screening suid sera and plasma for presence of RVFV antibodies in viraemic and recovered animals.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	30934604	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934604	flu	-6273159470243757969

1930	1930	584	Stroke	Prevention of Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation After Coronary Stenting.	Background and Purpose- The optimal antithrombotic strategy to balance thromboembolic and bleeding events, especially acute stroke, for patients with atrial fibrillation following coronary stenting remains a matter of debate. We conducted a network meta-analysis to identify the antithrombotic regimen associated with the lowest rate of bleeding and thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation after coronary stenting. Methods- PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central were searched for randomized controlled trials and observational studies of patients with atrial fibrillation after coronary stenting. The outcomes of interest were stroke, myocardial infarction, major adverse cardiac events, mortality, and major bleeding. A network meta-analysis was performed comparing the available antithrombotic regimens in the literature. Results- Three randomized and 15 observational studies were included, with a total of 23 478 participants. Median follow-up was 2 years. Network meta-analysis demonstrated that vitamin K antagonist plus single antiplatelet therapy or direct-acting oral anticoagulant plus single antiplatelet therapy were the most effective regimens in preventing stroke. Direct-acting oral anticoagulant regimens were associated with lower major bleeding rates than vitamin K antagonist regimens. Regimens with dual antiplatelet therapy were associated with lower rates of myocardial infarction. Vitamin K antagonist plus dual antiplatelet therapy was associated with a lower mortality and low-dose direct-acting oral anticoagulants with decreased major cardiovascular adverse events. Conclusions- Direct-acting oral anticoagulant regimens were associated with less major bleeding and major cardiovascular adverse events, but vitamin K antagonists were associated with decreased mortality and stroke. These results suggest that the decision of antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation after percutaneous coronary intervention needs to be individualized.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31303150	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303150	stroke	-5065077552540450930
1931	1931	59	Pharmaceutical statistics	Random effects models for estimation of the probability and time to progression of a continuous biomarker.	"Biomarkers play a key role in the monitoring of disease progression. The time taken for an individual to reach a biomarker exceeding or lower than a meaningful threshold is often of interest. Due to the inherent variability of biomarkers, persistence criteria are sometimes included in the definitions of progression, such that only two consecutive measurements above or below the relevant threshold signal that ""true"" progression has occurred. In previous work, a novel approach was developed, which allowed estimation of the time to threshold using the parameters from a linear mixed model where the residual variance was assumed to be pure measurement error. In this paper, we extend this methodology so that serial correlation can be accommodated. Assuming that the Markov property holds and applying the chain rule of probabilities, we found that the probability of progression at each timepoint can be expressed simply as the product of conditional probabilities. The methodology is applied to a cohort of HIV positive individuals, where the time to reach a CD4 count threshold is estimated. The second application we present is based on a study on abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the time taken for an individual to reach a diameter exceeding 55 mm is studied. We observed that erroneously ignoring the residual correlation when it is strong may result in substantial overestimation of the time to threshold. The estimated probability of the biomarker reaching a threshold of interest, expected time to threshold, and confidence intervals are presented for selected patients in both applications."	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31309691	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309691	HIV	2764830801602925772

A variety of respiratory viruses produce infections in humans with effects ranging from asymptomatic to life-treathening. Standard surveillance systems typically only target severe infections (ED outpatients, hospitalisations, deaths) and fail to track asymptomatic or mild infections. Here we performed a large-scale community study across multiple age groups to assess the pathogenicity of 18 respiratory viruses. We enrolled 214 individuals at multiple New York City locations and tested weekly for respiratory viral pathogens, irrespective of symptom status, from fall 2016 to spring 2018. We combined these test results with participant-provided daily records of cold and flu symptoms and used this information to characterise symptom severity by virus and age category. Asymptomatic infection rates exceeded 70% for most viruses, excepting influenza and human metapneumovirus, which produced significantly more severe outcomes. Symptoms were negatively associated with infection frequency, with children displaying the lowest score among age groups. Upper respiratory manifestations were most common for all viruses, whereas systemic effects were less typical. These findings indicate a high burden of asymptomatic respiratory virus infection exists in the general population.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31063096	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063096	flu	-8512461968928613053

1938	1938	460	Journal of hepatology	Report on the AASLD/EASL joint workshop on clinical trial endpoints in NAFLD.	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global public health concern. Its natural history, the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis, is highly variable, prone to endogenous (e.g., genetics, microbiota) and exogenous (e.g., nutrition, alcohol, physical activity) disease modifiers, and can fluctuate over time. The complexity of its pathophysiology is reflected by the multitude of pharmacological targets in development. NASH clinical trials have provided valuable insight that is applicable to future trial design. Endpoints for NASH have evolved over the past decade and will continue to be refined. Currently accepted endpoints for conditional approval include resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis and/or improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH by standardized evaluation of paired liver histology. In pediatric NASH, practical obstacles, pubertal hormonal changes, and stringent safety requirements mandate adaptations in trial design. In adult patients with NASH-related cirrhosis, decrease in portal pressure as well as clinical events (e.g. decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, transplantation, death) are more prevalent and thereby are viable primary endpoints for clinical trials. Consideration of the natural fluctuation of disease, the clinical implication of the chosen primary endpoint, and factors that may affect placebo response will facilitate an accurate determination of efficacy of emerging therapeutics for NASH. Conclusion: The June 2018 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and European Association for the Study of the Liver joint workshop on NAFLD endpoints summarized important findings from ongoing and completed trials, defined the scientific evidence supporting distinct endpoints, and provided guidance for future trial design.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31300231	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300231	Cirrhosis	-2554512494756911972

1941	1941	4	Cureus	A Case Report: Tragic Death in a Young Patient with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Due to Cryptococcal Meningitis.	Cryptococcal meningitis is a systemic infection that can be seen in immunosuppressed patients. Altered mental status, somnolence, and obtundation are warning signs of poor prognosis or advanced disease processes. We present a 23-year-old female with a past medical history significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) obtained via vertical transmission who presented to the emergency department (ED) with a gradual onset of worsening headache over 10 days, with blurry vision, photophobia, nausea and vomiting, and progressive memory lapses. Her blood tests, chest plain radiograph, and non-contrast brain computed tomography (CT) were normal. In the ED, she developed a fever of 102°F and became more confused and agitated, with interspersed screaming and yelling. A lumbar puncture (LP) showed elevated white blood cell count and was positive for Cryptococcus neoformans; an opening pressure was unable to be obtained due to patient agitation. Despite prompt intravenous antibiotics and antifungal medications, her short, but tenuous hospital course involved declining mental status, requiring intubation and multiple therapeutic lumbar punctures, with an elevated opening pressure of up to 55 cm H2O. The patient suffered global ischemic encephalopathy and died on hospital day two. This case highlights the rapid decompensation of a young immunocompromised patient with cryptococcal meningitis, as well as the importance of early disease management and consultation to neurology and neurosurgery services. An important paradigm difference for emergency medicine (EM) physicians in the management of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with cryptococcal meningitis is avoiding acetazolamide, mannitol, and steroids and considering the indication for neurosurgical interventions for severe cryptococcal meningitis.	2019	eng	Case Reports	United States	31312577	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312577	headache	7526364197140419661

The BA-responsive GPCRs S1PR2 and TGR5 are almost ubiquitously expressed in human and rodent tissues. In the liver, S1PR2 is expressed in all cell types, while TGR5 is predominately found in non-parenchymal cells. In contrast to S1PR2, which is mainly activated by conjugated bile acids (BAs), all BAs serve as ligands for TGR5 irrespective of their conjugation state and substitution pattern.Mice with targeted deletion of either S1PR2 or TGR5 are viable and develop no overt phenotype. In liver injury models, S1PR2 exerts pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects and thus aggravates liver damage, while TGR5 mediates anti-inflammatory, anti-cholestatic, and anti-fibrotic effects. Thus, inhibitors of S1PR2 signaling and agonists for TGR5 have been employed to attenuate liver injury in rodent models for cholestasis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and fibrosis/cirrhosis.In biliary epithelial cells, both receptors activate a similar signaling cascade resulting in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cell proliferation. Overexpression of both S1PR2 and TGR5 was found in human cholangiocarcinoma tissue as well as in CCA cell lines, where stimulation of both GPCRs resulted in transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and triggered cell proliferation as well as increased cell migration and invasiveness.This chapter will focus on the function of S1PR2 and TGR5 in different liver cell types and summarizes current knowledge on the role of these receptors in liver disease models.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31302759	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302759	Cirrhosis	-4138575697540914268
1945	1945	586	Trends in genetics : TIG	Templated Insertions: A Smoking Gun for Polymerase Theta-Mediated End Joining.	A recognized source of disease-causing genome alterations is erroneous repair of broken chromosomes, which can be executed by two distinct mechanisms: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and the recently discovered polymerase theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ) pathway. While TMEJ has previously been considered to act as an alternative mechanism backing up NHEJ, recent work points to a role for TMEJ in the repair of replication-associated DNA breaks that are excluded from repair through homologous recombination. Because of its mode of action, TMEJ is intrinsically mutagenic and sometimes leaves behind a recognizable genomic scar when joining chromosome break ends (i.e., 'templated insertions'). This review article focuses on the intriguing observation that this polymerase theta signature is frequently observed in disease alleles, arguing for a prominent role of this double-strand break repair pathway in genome diversification and disease-causing spontaneous mutagenesis in humans.	2019	eng	Review	England	31296341	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296341	smoking	-5027816744653977347

Dinitrogen activation and reduction is one of the most challenging and important subjects in chemistry. Herein, we report the N2 binding and reduction at the well-defined Ta3N3H- and Ta3N3- gas-phase clusters by using mass spec-trometry (MS), anion photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), and quantum-chemical calculations. The PES and calculation results show clear evidence that N2 can be adsorbed and completely activated by Ta3N3H- and Ta3N3- clusters, yielding to the products Ta3N5H- and Ta3N5-, but the reactivity of Ta3N3H- is five times higher than that of the dehydrogenated Ta3N3- clusters. The Detailed mechanistic investigations further indicate that a dissociative mechanism dominates the N2 activation reactions mediated by Ta3N3H- and Ta3N3-; two and three Ta atoms are active sites and also electron do-nors for the N2 reduction, respectively. Although the hydrogen atom in Ta3N3H- is not directly involved in the reaction, its very presence modifies the charge distribution and the geometry of Ta3N3H-, which is crucial to increase the reactiv-ity. The mechanisms revealed in this gas-phase study stress the fundamental rules for N2 activation and important role of transition metals as active sites as well as the new significant role of metal hydride bonds in the process of N2 reduc-tion, which provides molecular-level insights into the rational design of tantalum nitride-based catalysts for N2 fixa-tion and activation or NH3 synthesis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31314515	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314515	stress	-8159730897893673528

The Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) possesses a counter-regulatory axis composed of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2, angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] and the Mas receptor, which opposes many AT1-receptor-mediated effects of ligand angiotensin (Ang)II. Ang-(1-7), as a ligand of the Mas receptor, has inhibitory effects on renal inflammation and fibrosis in experimental diabetes. However, Ang-(1-7) has a short half-life in plasma, which may render it unsuitable for use in clinics. Here, we investigated the effects of the lanthionine-stabilized Ang-(1-7), cyclic (c)Ang-(1-7), a lanthipeptide that is more peptidase-resistant than the linear peptide, in BTBR ob/ob mice with type 2 diabetic nephropathy (DN). BTBR ob/ob mice received vehicle, cAng-(1-7), or the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. The treatment started at ten weeks of age, when the animals had already developed albuminuria, and ended at 19-20 weeks of age. cAng-(1-7) limited albuminuria progression, and limited podocyte dysfunction similarly to lisinopril. cAng-(1-7), unlike lisinopril, reduced glomerular fibrosis and inflammation, and counteracted glomerular capillary rarefaction. Furthermore, when cAng-(1-7) was combined with lisinopril, a superior antiproteinuric effect than with lisinopril alone was found, in association with better preservation of podocyte proteins and amelioration of capillary density. Thus, adding cAng-(1-7) to ACE-inhibitor therapy could benefit those diabetic patients who do not respond completely to ACE-inhibitor therapy.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31307778	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307778	diabetes	8028897172674067530

The purpose of this cross-sectional survey study was to explore common barriers to adequate Pap smear utilization among homeless women, and the factors that may relate to cervical cancer testing in this population. Participants consisted of adult women recruited at a healthcare facility for the homeless. Data were collected through a self-completed questionnaire on knowledge, attitudes and intentions about Pap smears and cervical cancer. Analyses included descriptive and inferential statistics. Sixty participants who had experienced homelessness within the past year completed the study. The most frequently mentioned barrier to testing was not having enough time to obtain a Pap smear (n = 33; 55%). Linear regression found that there were no significant relationships between knowledge and attitudes about cervical cancer and intention to get a Pap smear. However, the study did find that women with a positive previous Pap smear experience had more positive attitudes about the process and outcomes of Pap smears (p = 0.011, p = 0.00, respectively). Participants with more knowledge about cervical cancer were less negative about Pap smear outcomes (p = 0.05), and that women with negative attitudes about Pap smear outcomes were less likely to have obtained a Pap smear in the past (p = 0.033). Interventions that promote positive attitudes about testing and outcomes, minimizing stress and inconvenience during the test, as well as increasing the ease of scheduling an appointment may help break down barriers to cervical cancer screening among homeless women.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31313028	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313028	cancer	161784308223385549

1960	1960	12	PloS one	Immune-regulatory microRNA expression levels within circulating extracellular vesicles correspond with the appearance of local symptoms after seasonal flu vaccination.	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate the innate immune responses, such as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines after vaccination can cause local adverse reactions, such as pain, itching, swelling, and redness. Previous studies have shown that circulating EV miR-451a regulates innate immune responses, and miR-451a levels in serum EVs are negatively correlated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine expression levels in response to the influenza vaccine. Since excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production is a cause of the local adverse reactions to vaccination, we investigated whether miR-451a levels in serum EVs correlate with local symptoms at the vaccination site, such as pain, itching, swelling, and redness. Interestingly, miR-451a levels in serum EVs were inversely correlated with the number of symptoms after vaccination. We determined the level of several other immune-regulatory miRNAs in serum EVs. Using the immune-regulatory miRNA levels of miR-22, miR-29a, miR-451a, and miR-107, we calculated a normalized miRNA level for each healthy donor and found that the normalized miRNA levels were significantly correlated with the number of local symptoms after vaccination. Our data indicated that immune-regulatory miRNA levels in serum EVs can be used as biomarkers to assess local symptoms after influenza vaccination.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31287847	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287847	flu	-1634742667970363668

Recently, the mean maternal age at first birth has been continuing to increase. The decline in the age-related fertility is due to the reduction in the number and the quality of the oocyte. An elevation in intra-ovarian reactive oxygen species (ROS) is correlated with the increase in maternal age, and the oxidative stress is involved in the decline in oocyte quality. Although β-carotene, a very effective quencher of ROS, has been found to have the beneficial contribution to the ovarian development and steroidogenesis, it is unknown the effect of β-carotene on the oocyte development especially oocyte maturation. This investigation aimed to explore the beneficial contribution of β-carotene on oocyte maturation under oxidative stress and the underlying mechanism. We found that the oxidative stress induced by ROS reagent Rosup inhibited oocyte development/maturation and parthenogenetic activation which could be dramatically rescued by β-carotene (57.1 ± 4.7% vs 78.9 ± 3.8%; p < 0.05) in vitro. The underlying mechanisms include that β-carotene not only reduces ROS formation and cell apoptosis, but also it can restore actin expression, cortical granule-free domain (CGFD) formation, mitochondria homogeneous distribution, and nuclear maturation. The data suggest that β-carotene acts as a potential antioxidant in the oocyte. Therefore, the findings from this investigation provide the fundamental 7knowledge for using β-carotene as an antioxidant to improve the oocyte quality and even the ovarian function.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31313007	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313007	stress	335910242745901755

This is a document prepared by the Association for Bariatric Endoscopy (ABE), a division of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) and the ASGE Training Committee. This curriculum document contains recommendations for training and is intended for use by gastroenterology program directors and faculty, including those involved in teaching endoscopy, and trainees in gastroenterology. Although only a small proportion of gastroenterologists currently treat obesity, given the burden of disease, an urgent need exists for greater involvement of physicians from multiple specialties, including gastroenterology, to be actively involved in the care of patients with obesity. This curriculum was developed to provide an overview of the cognitive and technical content areas that gastroenterology (GI) fellows should learn pertaining to the evaluation and management of patients with obesity and to serve as a guide to published references, videos, and other available resources. Specifically, this document addresses the core concepts that all general gastroenterology fellows should acquire about lifestyle intervention; pharmacologic, endoscopic, and surgical treatments for obesity; evaluation and management of gastrointestinal comorbidities in patients with obesity; challenges associated with sedation in patients with obesity; endoscopic evaluation of postbariatric surgical anatomy; and the management of selected adverse events in patients who have had bariatric surgery. The document also suggests recommendations for those fellows who are interested in acquiring further skills in the treatment of obesity such as incorporating medical treatment of obesity in their practice or those interested in offering endoscopic bariatric therapies (EBTs), treatment of more complex bariatric surgical adverse events, or endoscopic treatment of weight regain after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). By providing this framework to trainers and trainees, the ASGE hopes to facilitate the incorporation of this important material into training programs to ensure that trainees are adequately prepared for future professional responsibilities in this area.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31302093	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302093	obesity	7191770005709670956

Background Adverse events (AEs) not listed on drug labels have recently been reported in young girls vaccinated against HPV, but signal detection related to the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has never been conducted in South Korea using the Korea Adverse Event Reporting System database of Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management at Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. Objective To analyze signals associated with HPV vaccines using the Korean spontaneous AEs reporting system and data-mining methods and compare the results to current vaccine label information in South Korea and the United States of America, United Kingdom, European Union, and Japan to detect signals not currently listed on the labels. Setting We evaluated the Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management database from January 2005 to December 2016. After pre-screening the data, the adjusted total numbers of HPV-related AE reports and AEs were 2566 and 4748 and those of all other vaccine-related AE reports and AEs were 21,878 and 120,688, respectively. Methods Three data mining algorithms (proportional reporting ratio, reporting odds ratio and information component) were used to assess AEs. A signal was defined when the criteria for all three indicators were satisfied. The detected signals were compared to the label information of HPV vaccines from South Korea, the United States of America, United Kingdom, European Union, and Japan. Main outcome measure Signals of AE after HPV vaccination, which met all three data mining indices. Results In this study, we found a total 97 signals of AE after HPV vaccination. Of these, 78 AEs were already present on the HPV vaccine labels of South Korea and the following 19 AEs were not listed: neuralgia, tremor, neuritis, depersonalization, axillary pain, personality disorder, increased salivation, peptic ulcer, circulatory failure, hypotension, peripheral ischemia, cerebral hemorrhage, micturition disorder, facial edema, ovarian cyst, weight increase, pain anxiety, oral edema, and back pain. Moreover, AE information on the current HPV vaccine labels of South Korea, the United States of America, United Kingdom, European Union, and Japan was inconsistent. When comparing the 19 AE signals that were not listed on the drug label in South Korea with the labels from the other countries, neuritis, axillary pain, cerebral hemorrhage, facial edema, pain anxiety, and back pain appreared on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration HPV vaccine labels but not on the United Kingdom labels, and hypotension was listed only on labels in the European Union and Japan. Conclusions South Korea should develop a system for proactively updating HPV labels. These results also suggest potential research directions such as vaccination label expansion, pharmacovigilance studies, and identification of causality in AEs associated with HPV vaccination.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31313003	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313003	vaccine	8326017498198914888

Recently, there has been an increased interest in the feasibility and impact of automation within the field of medical dosimetry. While there have been many commercialized solutions for automatic treatment planning, the use of an application programming interface to achieve complete plan generation for specific treatment sites is a process only recently available for certain commercial vendors. Automatic plan generation for 20 prostate patients was achieved via a stand-alone automated planning script that accessed a knowledge-based planning solution. Differences between the auto plans and clinically treated, baseline plans were analyzed and compared. The planning script successfully initialized a treatment plan, accessed the knowledge-based planning model, optimized the plan, assessed for constraint compliance, and normalized the treatment plan for maximal coverage while meeting constraints. Compared to baseline plans, the auto-generated plans showed significantly improved rectal sparing with similar coverage for targets and comparable doses to the remaining organs-at-risk. Utilization of a script, with its associated time saving and integrated process management, can quickly and automatically generate an acceptable clinical treatment plan for prostate cancer with either improved or similar results compared to a manually created plan.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313508	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313508	cancer	5653476548835345267

Maternal smoking causes lower birth weight, birth defects, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Epidemiological evidence over the past four decades has grown stronger and the adverse outcomes attributed to maternal smoking and secondhand smoke exposure have expanded. This review presents findings of latent and persistent metabolic effects in offspring of smoking mothers like those observed in studies of maternal undernutrition during pregnancy. The phenotype of offspring of smoking mothers is like that associated with maternal undernutrition. Born smaller than offspring of nonsmokers, these children have increased risk of being overweight or obese later. Plausible mechanisms include in utero hypoxia, nicotine-induced reductions in uteroplacental blood flow, placental toxicity, or toxic growth restriction from the many toxicants in tobacco smoke. Studies have reported increased risk of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and hypertension although the evidence here is weaker than for overweight/obesity. Altered DNA methylation has been consistently documented in smoking mothers' offspring, and these epigenetic alterations are extensive and postnatally durable. A causal link between altered DNA methylation and the phenotypic changes observed in offspring remains to be firmly established, yet the association is strong, and mediation analyses suggest a causal link. Studies examining expression patterns of affected genes during childhood development and associated health outcomes should be instructive in this regard. The adverse effects of exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy now clearly include permanent metabolic derangements in offspring that can adversely affect life-long health.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31313499	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313499	diabetes	-6115752106105570167
1979	1979	300	 	Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: The Overlooked Complication of Type 2 Diabetes	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common complication of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Most times it is an unrecognized comorbidity to the primary care provider and endocrinologist. Today it is the most common chronic liver disease in developed countries. It is characterized by insulin resistance and hepatic triglyceride accumulation in the absence of co-existing etiologies, such as excessive alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis, medications or other etiologies for hepatic steatosis. Its more severe form of the disease with steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with hepatocyte injury (necrosis and inflammation) and frequently with fibrosis. Although it appears to be an indolent condition, with few symptoms and often normal plasma aminotransferases, NASH is a leading cause of end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and significantly increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and T2DM. The pathogenesis of NASH remains poorly understood, and likely to be multifactorial, but insulin-resistant adipose tissue plays an important role. The natural history of NAFLD is incompletely understood, but risk factors for disease progression include weight gain, obesity and T2DM, as well as the severity of fibrosis stage at diagnosis. Diagnostic algorithms are evolving but we offer an approach that integrates for the non-hepatologist plasma biomarkers, imaging, and the role of liver biopsy for the management of these complex patients. At the present time, early screening -with biomarker panels or a liver ultrasound, ideally with transient elastography- is reserved for high-risk patients (i.e., obese patients with T2DM or elevated plasma AST/ALT levels or evidence of steatosis at a random liver exam) until more accurate non-invasive methods are available. A liver biopsy should be considered on a case-by-case basis, to identify those at risk of NASH-cirrhosis, working in close collaboration with a hepatologist. Treatment should include a comprehensive approach with lifestyle modification and therapeutic agents tested in RCTs, such as vitamin E (in patients without diabetes) or pioglitazone for patients with or without diabetes. Pioglitazone, given its low-cost as a generic medication, long-standing track record of efficacy in NASH, and cardiometabolic benefits, is likely to be for NASH what metformin has become for the management of T2DM. However, proper patient selection and close monitoring is needed. In addition, a number of new pharmacological agents are being studied in phase II/III trials and future management will involve the use of combination therapy, as for other chronic metabolic conditions. In summary, endocrinologists need to be aware of the severe metabolic and liver-specific complications of NASH and establish early-on a long-term management plan. Screening will likely take place in the same way as for diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy. A better understanding of its natural history and pathogenesis of NASH, combined with improved diagnostic and treatment options, will likely place endocrinologists at the forefront of the management efforts to prevent end-stage liver disease in patients with NASH.

Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) is the electrophysiological substrate of migraine aura, and a putative trigger of trigeminovascular activation and migraine headache. Many migraineurs report stress or relief after a stress triggers an attack. We tested whether various stress conditions might modulate CSD susceptibility and whether this is dependent on genetic factors. Male and female wild type and familial hemiplegic migraine type1 (FHM1) knock-in mice heterozygous for the S218 L missense mutation were subjected to acute or chronic stress, or chronic stress followed by relief (36 h). Acute stress was induced by restraint and exposure to bright light and white noise (3 h). Chronic stress was induced for 28 days by two cycles of repeated exposure of mice to a rat (7d), physical restraint (3d), and forced swimming (3d). Electrical CSD threshold and KCl-induced (300 mM) CSD frequency were determined in occipital cortex in vivo at the end of each protocol. Relief after chronic stress reduced the electrical CSD threshold and increased the frequency of KCl-induced CSDs in FHM1 mutants only. Acute or chronic stress without relief did not affect CSD susceptibility in either strain. Stress status did not affect CSD propagation speed, duration or amplitude. In summary, relief after chronic stress, but not acute or chronic stress alone, augments CSD in genetically susceptible mice. Therefore, enhanced CSD susceptibility may explain why, in certain patients, migraine attacks typically occur during a period of stress relief such as weekends or holidays.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31299346	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299346	headache	-5055745575969002313
1981	1981	105	PloS one	The influence of personality on memory self-report among black and white older adults.	Self-reported memory problems are often the first indicator of cognitive decline; however, they are inconsistently associated with objective memory performance and are known to be influenced by individual factors, such as personality. The current study examined the relationships between personality traits and self-reported memory problems in cognitively intact older adults, and whether these associations differ across Black and White older adults. Data were collected annually via in-person comprehensive medical and neuropsychological examinations as part of the Einstein Aging Study. Community-dwelling older adults in an urban, multi-ethnic area of New York City were interviewed. The current study included a total of 425 older adults (Mage = 76.68, SD = 4.72, 62.59% female; 72.00% White). Multilevel modeling tested the associations of neuroticism, conscientiousness, extraversion, openness, and agreeableness with self-reported memory problems. Results showed that neuroticism was positively related to frequency of memory problems and perceived ten-year memory decline only when other personality traits were not accounted for. Extraversion was negatively related to frequency of memory problems and perceived ten-year decline for both White and Black participants. However, conscientiousness was negatively related to perceived ten-year decline for Black participants only. Our findings highlight the importance of examining the association of all five personality traits with self-reported memory problems, as well as examining whether these associations differ for participants from different race/ethnicities.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31306444	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306444	aging	-5628897645967553681
1982	1982	66	Biochimie	Stringent response protein as a potential target to intervene persistent bacterial infection.	More than half of the world's population is infected with persistent bacterial infections, consequently, persisters are gradually becoming a major public health concern. During the persistent phase, bacterial pathogens deploy many regulatory strategies to compensate unfavorable host environmental conditions. The stringent response is one of such gene regulatory mechanisms which is stimulated by nutrient starvation. It is regulated by the synthesis of highly phosphorylated signaling nucleotides, (p)ppGpp or alarmone. (p)ppGpp is synthesized by ppGpp synthetases, and these proteins are classified as RelA/SpoT homolog (RSH) proteins. Subsequently, (p)ppGpp modulate several molecular and biochemical processes ranging from transcription to metabolism. Imperativeness of (p)ppGpp synthetases has been investigated by numerous approaches including microbiology and animal studies, thereby establishing that Rel enzyme deleted strains of pathogenic bacteria were unable to transform in persister form. In this review, we summarize recent findings to corroborate the rationality to consider (p)ppGpp synthetase as a potential target in discovering a novel class of antimicrobial agents to combat persistent infections. Moreover, inhibition studies on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (p)ppGpp synthetase shows that these inhibitors prevent dormant state transition and biofilm formation. Also, we have highlighted the structural biology of (p)ppGpp synthetases, which may provide significant information that could be used in structure-based inhibitor design.	2019	eng	Review	France	31302165	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302165	tuberculosis	5237574390644778994

1984	1984	734	Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD	Dementia Risk Elevates Brain Activity During Memory Retrieval: A Functional MRI Analysis of Middle Aged and Older Adults.	Longitudinal research suggests that genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors enhance one's risk for developing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). However, it is not known how an accumulation of such factors impact brain functioning. One barrier to this research is that increased risk for ADRD affects the cerebrovascular system and, therefore, alters the link between neural activity and the fMRI BOLD signal. To better interpret fMRI findings, several steps were taken to adjust fMRI activity thereby reducing such cerebrovascular effects. We hypothesized that as the number of ADRD risk factors increase, brain regions within the medial temporal lobes and the default mode network would exhibit altered brain activity during an episodic memory retrieval task. Middle-aged and older adults (aged 50-74) free of dementia were recruited with varying levels of risk and underwent a neuropsychological battery and fMRI. In the memory task, participants viewed a pair of pictures. In an alternative-forced-choice test, participants viewed a picture cue and had to determine which of four pictures was paired with the cue. Increased dementia risk was positively associated with brain activity in regions of interest within the default mode network, the hippocampus, and the entorhinal cortex during memory retrieval. Whole-brain analyses revealed additional positive associations in prefrontal and occipito-temporal cortices. Risk factors most contributing to these elevated levels of brain activity included hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and cholesterol. We also ruled out confounds due to in-scanner performance and premorbid ability. Cumulative risk might represent early signs of burnout in brain regions underlying episodic memory.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31306118	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306118	obesity	5380540855517464621

Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) is a promising biotherapeutic tool that has been used as a vaccine against both infectious diseases and cancer. saRNA has been shown to induce protein expression for up to 60 days and elicit immune responses with lower dosing than messenger RNA (mRNA). Because saRNA is a large (~9500 nt), negatively charged molecule, it requires a delivery vehicle for efficient cellular uptake and degradation protection. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for RNA formulations, where the prevailing paradigm is to encapsulate RNA within the particle, including the first FDA-approved small-interfering siRNA therapy. Here, we compared LNP formulations with cationic and ionizable lipids with saRNA either on the interior or exterior of the particle. We show that LNPs formulated with cationic lipids protect saRNA from RNAse degradation, even when it is adsorbed to the surface. Furthermore, cationic LNPs deliver saRNA equivalently to particles formulated with saRNA encapsulated in an ionizable lipid particle, both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that cationic and ionizable LNP formulations induce equivalent antibodies against HIV-1 Env gp140 as a model antigen. These studies establish formulating saRNA on the surface of cationic LNPs as an alternative to the paradigm of encapsulating RNA.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31300730	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300730	vaccine	2359690284139785648

Pediatric burn injuries are stressful for parents, yet few burn clinics report screening caregivers. We evaluated psychometric properties of a 2-item depression screener administered to parents of children with burns during outpatient clinic visits. We also examined associations between parent depression symptoms and child characteristics. We used a retrospective review of pediatric patients with burn injuries (n=496, age range 0-21 years; M=5.0 years, SD=4.4 years) from an outpatient specialty burn clinic. Sample was 54.8% male; ethnicity was 42.4% Black/African American and 42.2% White. Most children (94.7%) had a burn total body surface area of 10% or less and partial thickness burns (87%). Depression measure was administered at two time points as part of routine care: T1 (n=496) and T2 (n=121). Score range was 0-8. The means were 1.17 (SD=1.74) at T1 and .81 (SD=1.40) at T2. The majority scored ≤ 3 (89.9% caregivers) at T1. The measure demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency at T1 (Cronbach α= 0.74) and T2 (α = 0.82). Scores at T1 and T2 for a subsample (n=121) were related (r= .61, p < .001). Parents of non-White children tended to report higher depression scores at T1. At T2, being female and greater burn degree were associated with higher depression scores This brief 2-item scale used with caregivers of pediatric burn patients is a reasonable method for screening parental depression in this setting. Given the association between parental depression and child characteristics, further studies are needed including examination of predictive validity of parental depression with pediatric outcomes.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31304969	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304969	depression	-3387888707667201720
1989	1989	605	Frontiers in aging neuroscience	Decoding the Role of Platelets and Related MicroRNAs in Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders.	Platelets are anucleate cells that circulate in blood and are essential components of the hemostatic system. During aging, platelet numbers decrease and their aggregation capacity is reduced. Platelet dysfunctions associated with aging can be linked to molecular alterations affecting several cellular systems that include cytoskeleton rearrangements, signal transduction, vesicular trafficking, and protein degradation. Age platelets may adopt a phenotype characterized by robust secretion of extracellular vesicles that could in turn account for about 70-90% of blood circulating vesicles. Interestingly these extracellular vesicles are loaded with messenger RNAs and microRNAs that may have a profound impact on protein physiology at the systems level. Age platelet dysfunction is also associated with accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Thereby understanding the mechanisms of aging in platelets as well as their age-dependent dysfunctions may be of interest when evaluating the contribution of aging to the onset of age-dependent pathologies, such as those affecting the nervous system. In this review we summarize the findings that link platelet dysfunctions to neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Huntington's Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. We discuss the role of platelets as drivers of protein dysfunctions observed in these pathologies, their association with aging and the potential clinical significance of platelets, and related miRNAs, as peripheral biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31312134	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312134	Alzheimer	6540624159201421051

In 2012, a new influenza vaccine - FLU4 was first licensed in the US. FLU4 is a quadrivalent flu vaccine, which can protect against four flu viruses. Compared to FLU and FLU3, FLU4 gives broader protection against the flu viruses. To our knowledge, few studies have focused on the FLU4 vaccine and its adverse events. Since safety signal detection is important in vaccination, it is necessary to launch such studies on FLU4. In this paper, we used the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which is a national post-marketing vaccine safety surveillance program to identify rare adverse events with year-varying reporting rates for FLU4. The differences in the reporting rates over years are potential signals of vaccine safety issues caused by updates of FLU4 ingredients. We used a likelihood ratio test to simultaneously test the sparsity of events and the differences of event rates over years. We identified 4 adverse events that are rare and have significantly different reporting rates over years.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	30815200	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30815200	flu	-797853000484445213

1993	1993	120	Aging	Age-associated changes of the intrinsic nervous system in relation with interstitial cells in the pre-weaning goat rumen.	In this study, we investigated the neural changes and their relationships with interstitial cells (ICs) in the rumen of pre-weaning goats by transmission electron microscopy, western blot and immunofluorescence (antibody: general neuronal marker-Protein Gene Product (PGP9.5)/ IC marker-vimentin). The immunofluorescence results showed that PGP9.5-positive reaction was widely distributed in neuronal soma (NS) and nerve fibre (NF). The NSs were observed in the ganglia of the myenteric plexus (MP) but not in the submucosal plexus. The mean optical density (MOD) of the whole of PGP9.5-positive nerves and the protein expression level of PGP.5 in the rumen wall both decreased significantly with age. However an obvious increase MOD of PGP.5-positive NFs within the rumen epithelium were observed. In the MP, the nerves and ICs were interwoven to form two complex networks that gradually tightened with age. Furthermore, NSs and nerve trunks were surrounded by a ring-boundary layer consisting of several ICs that became physically closer with aging. Moreover, ICs were located nearby NFs within the ML, forming connections between ICs, smooth muscle cells and axons. This study describes the pattern of neural distribution and its association with ICs in the developing rumen which shed light on the postpartum development of ruminants.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31305258	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305258	aging	-7387185690512762935

The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor saxagliptin is a widely used antihyperglycemic agent in patients with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of saxagliptin on endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes. This was a prospective, multicenter, interventional study. A total of 34 patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled at four university hospitals in Japan. Treatment of patients was initially started with saxagliptin at a dose of 5 mg daily. Assessment of endothelial function assessed by flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) and measurement of stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) were conducted at baseline and at 3 months after treatment with saxagliptin. A total of 31 patients with type 2 diabetes were included in the analysis. Saxagliptin significantly increased FMD from 3.1 ± 3.1% to 4.2 ± 2.4% (P = 0.032) and significantly decreased total cholesterol from 190 ± 24 mg/dL to 181 ± 25 mg/dL (P = 0.002), glucose from 160 ± 53 mg/dL to 133 ± 25 mg/dL (P < 0.001), HbA1c from 7.5 ± 0.6% to 7.0 ± 0.6% (P < 0.001), urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio from 63.8 ± 134.2 mg/g to 40.9 ± 83.0 mg/g (P = 0.043), and total SDF-1α from 2108 ± 243 pg/mL to 1284 ± 345 pg/mL (P < 0.001).

2012	2012	57	Sociology of health & illness	The becoming-methadone-body: on the onto-politics of health intervention translations.	In this paper, we reflect on health intervention translations as matters of their implementation practices. Our case is methadone treatment, an intervention promoted globally for treating opioid dependence and preventing HIV among people who inject drugs. Tracing methadone's translations in high-security prisons in the Kyrgyz Republic, we notice the multiple methadones made possible, what these afford, and the onto-political effects they make. We work with the idea of the 'becoming-methadone-body' to trace the making-up of methadone treatment and its effects as an intra-action of human and nonhuman substances and bodies. Methadone's embodied effects flow beyond the mere psycho-activity of substances incorporating individual bodies, to material highs and lows incorporating the governing practices of prisoner society. The methadone-in-practice of prisoner society is altogether different to that imagined as being in translation as an intervention of HIV prevention and opioid treatment, and has material agency as a practice of societal governance. Heroin also emerges as an actor in these relations. Our analysis troubles practices of 'evidence-based' intervention and 'implementation science' in the health field, by arguing for a move towards 'evidence-making' intervention approaches. Noticing the onto-politics of health intervention translations invites speculation on how intervening might be done differently.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31310008	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310008	HIV	-3920984929373505016

Reassortment contributes to the evolution of RNA viruses with segmented genomes, including Bluetongue virus (BTV). Recently, co-circulation of natural and vaccine BTV variants in Europe, and their ensuing reassortment, were proposed to promote appearance of novel European BTV strains, with potential implications for pathogenicity, spread and vaccination policies. Similarly, the geographical features of the Mediterranean basin, which spans over portions of three continents, may facilitate the appearance of clinically relevant reassortants via co-circulation of BTV strains of African, Asian and European origins. In August-October 2017, BTV serotype 6 (BTV-6) was identified in young animals exhibiting classical clinical signs of Bluetongue (BT) at Israeli sheep and cattle farms. Sequencing and pairwise analysis of this Israeli BTV-6 isolate revealed the closest sequence homology of its serotype-defining Segment 2 was with that of South African reference BTV-6 strain 5011 (93.88% identity). In contrast, the other viral segments showed highest homology (97.0%-99.47% identity) with BTV-3, -4 and -9 of Mediterranean and African origins. Specifically, four viral segments were nearly identical (99.13%-99.47%), with Tunisian and Italian BTV-3 strains (TUN2016 and SAD2018, correspondingly). Together, our data suggest that Mediterranean co-circulation and reassortment of BTV-3 and BTV-6 drove the emergence of a novel and virulent BTV-6 strain.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31295819	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295819	vaccine	8482750322470893687

Blood investigations showed that he had eosinophilia, and skin biopsy demonstrated dermal vasculitis with eosinophils. He was found to be MPO-C-ANCA positive, and although initially thought to have granulomatosis with polyangiitis, the diagnosis was later revised to EGPA.

2022	2022	396	Transboundary and emerging diseases	A novel H7N3 reassortant originating from the zoonotic H7N9 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses that has adapted to ducks.	The first human case of zoonotic H7N9 avian influenza virus (AIV) infection was reported in March 2013 in China. This virus continues to circulate in poultry in China while mutating to highly pathogenic AIVs (HPAIVs). Through monitoring at airports in Japan, a novel H7N3 reassortant of the zoonotic H7N9 HPAIVs, A/duck/Japan/AQ-HE30-1/2018 (HE30-1), was detected in a poultry meat product illegally brought by a passenger from China into Japan. We analyzed the genetic, pathogenic, and antigenic characteristics of HE30-1 by comparing it with previous zoonotic H7N9 AIVs and their reassortants. Phylogenetic analysis of the entire HE30-1 genomic sequence revealed that it comprised at least three different sources; the HA (H7), PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS segments of HE30-1 were directly derived from H7N9 AIVs, whereas the NA (N3) and PB2 segments of HE30-1 were unrelated to zoonotic H7N9. Experimental infection revealed that HE30-1 was lethal in chickens but not in domestic or mallard ducks. HE30-1 was shed from and replicated in domestic and mallard ducks and chickens, whereas previous zoonotic H7N9 AIVs have not adapted well to ducks. This finding suggests the possibility that HE30-1 may disseminate to remote area by wild bird migration once it establishes in wild bird population. A hemagglutination-inhibition assay indicated that antigenic drift has occurred among the reassortants of zoonotic H7N9 AIVs; HE30-1 showed similar antigenicity to some of those H7N9 AIVs, suggesting it might be prevented by the H5/H7 inactivated vaccine that was introduced in China in 2017. Our study reports the emergence of a new reassortant of zoonotic H7N9 AIVs with novel viral characteristics and warns of the challenge we still face to control the zoonotic H7N9 AIVs and their reassortants.

Cardiovascular disease predominantly includes coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, results in high morbidity and mortality. MicroRNA-143-3p (miR-143-3p) is a tumor suppressor and is involved in many cancers. However, the role and mechanism of miR-143-3p in coronary heart disease is still unclear. In this study, we identified that miR-143-3p was up-regulated in rabbit CHD model. The results of TargetScan and the dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that KLLN (killin, p53 regulated DNA replication inhibitor) was a direct target of miR-143-3p. Besides, we revealed that KLLN was down-regulated in rabbit coronary heart disease model. In addition, we found that the related-markers of CHD such as TC (total cholesterol), TG (triglyceride), and LDLC (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) in the model group were significantly increased than that in the control group. And compared with the model group, miR-143-3p inhibitor significantly reduced TC, TG, LDLC expression, while miR-143-3p mimic further increased the expression of TC, TG, and LDLC. We next found that miR-143-3p mimic promoted cell viability and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells, inhibited apoptosis; and these changes were reversed by KLLN-plasmid. And miR-143-3p inhibitor had the counter effects. Our study provided a new target for the treatment of CHD and deserves further study.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31312371	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312371	heart+disease	3609315114795782005

2028	2028	345	IUBMB life	Listeriolysin O immunogenetic adjuvant enhanced potency of hepatitis C virus NS3 DNA vaccine.	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major health problem all over the world. Among HCV proteins, nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) is one of the most promising target for anti-HCV therapy and a candidate for vaccine design. DNA vaccine is an efficient approach to stimulate antigen-specific immunity but the main problem with that is less immunogenic efficiency in comparison with traditional vaccines. Several approaches have been applied to enhance the immunogenicity of DNA. Recently, bacteria-derived substances are considered as one of the most attractive adjuvants for vaccines, which among them, Listeriolysin O (LLO) of Listeria monocytogenes is a toxin with an extremely immunogenic feature. We investigated detoxified form of LLO gene as genetic adjuvant to modulate NS3 DNA vaccine potency. Immunogenic truncated NS3 gene sequence of HCV (1095-1380aa) and detoxified LLO gene region (5-441aa) were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 plasmid separately. The expression of recombinant proteins (pc-NS3, pLLO) was confirmed in HEK293T cell line by western blotting. BALB/c mice models received three doses of different formula of plasmids in two-week intervals and two weeks after the final immunization, the immune responses were evaluated by specific total antibody level, lymphocyte proliferation, cytotoxicity, and cytokine levels assays. To evaluate in vivo cytotoxic activity, tumor challenge was performed. The recombinant plasmids were successfully expressed in mammalian cell line, and coadministration of pc-NS3 with pLLO induced the highest titer of total IgG against NS3 antigen compared with other controls. Determination of IgG subclasses confirmed the efficient increase in mixed responses with Th1 dominancy. Furthermore, significant levels of cytokines (p < .05) and lymphocyte proliferation responses (p < .05) indicated the superiority of this regimen. The findings may have important implication for LLO gene application as genetic adjuvant in immune response against HCV.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31298809	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298809	vaccine	-5649504870272917833

Berry aneurysm rupture is the second most common cause following trauma. Diagnosis is often challenging. Neurogenic heart syndrome often complicates subarachnoid hemorrhage. A concomitant pheochromocytoma can be deadly causing sudden cardiac arrhythmia. Here, we describe a case of subarachnoid hemorrhage with concomitant incidental pheochromocytoma in a relatively young female who died suddenly, diagnosed during autopsy. A 57-year-old Hispanic woman with past medical history of asthma, prediabetes, and uncontrolled hypertension collapsed unexpectedly. She initially had ventricular tachycardia, followed by pulseless electrical activity and finally asystole without response to resuscitation. In the emergency department she was on epinephrine, calcium, naloxone, and tPA with suspected thrombotic stroke. Despite measures, she was pronounced dead. Autopsy revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured berry aneurysm. Additionally, pheochromocytoma was detected in the right adrenal gland. Subarachnoid hemorrhage has a grave prognosis by itself. This case describes the uncommon detection of pheochromocytoma in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage.	2019	eng	Case Reports	United States	31281701	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31281701	asthma	-825802007843492131

Suspected diagnosis of cancer was then retained based on the presence of vaginal bleeding on contact and abdominopelvic CT scan results showing cervical cancer. Biopsy was indicated in order to confirm the diagnosis histologically. Anatomo-pathological examination objectified epitheliogigantocellular granuloma with caseous necrosis, supporting cervical tuberculosis. The other examinations were negative.

After the initial identification of the H1N1 pandemic influenza strain in Mexico in April 2009 and its subsequent global spread, several monovalent influenza vaccines were developed as part of the pandemic response. Three of these vaccines, Pandemrix, Arepanrix and Focetria were adjuvanted. One of these, the AS03-adjuvanted Pandemrix vaccine, was primarily used in Europe. Following widespread Pandemrix vaccine administration in Scandinavia, an increased risk of narcolepsy was noted in observational studies. Subsequently, this increased risk was also reported in other European countries as well. In contrast, studies from Canada of a similar AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, Arepanrix, did not demonstrate a similar increased risk of narcolepsy. No studies have identified an increased risk of narcolepsy following the MF59-adjuvanted Focetria vaccine. For many potential pandemic influenza strains, adjuvants might be required to solicit a protective immune response. Thus, it is critical that we understand the nature of the association between adjuvanted vaccine receipt and narcolepsy. Here, we present a potential hypothesis for narcolepsy seen during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccine recipients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31306400	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306400	vaccine	7286613907013366088

So far, there has been no effective cure for osteoporotic cortical bone, the most significant change in long bone structure during aging and the main cause of bone fragility fractures, because its underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain largely unknown. We used 3- and 15-mo-old mice as well as 15-mo-old mice treated with vehicle and gefitinib to evaluate structural, cellular, and molecular changes in cortical bone. We found that the senescence of osteoprogenitors was increased, whereas the expression of phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the endosteal surface of cortical bone down-regulated in middle-aged 15-mo-old mice compared with young 3-mo-old mice. Further decreasing EGFR signaling by gefitinib treatment in middle-aged mice resulted in promoted senescence of osteoprogenitors and accelerated cortical bone degeneration. Moreover, inhibiting EGFR signaling suppressed the expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), the repressor of cell senescence-inducer genes, through ERK1/2 pathway, thereby promoting senescence in osteoprogenitors. Down-regulated EGFR signaling plays a physiologically significant role during aging by reducing Ezh2 expression, leading to the senescence of osteoprogenitors and the decline in bone formation on the endosteal surface of cortical bone.-Liu, G., Xie, Y., Su, J., Qin, H., Wu, H., Li, K., Yu, B., Zhang, X.

Hyperphosphorylated tau is a major component of neurofibrillary tangles, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates are also found in many neurodegenerative diseases, collectively referred to as ""tauopathies,"" and tau mutations are associated with familiar frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Previous studies have generated transgenic mice with mutant tau as tauopathy models, but non-human primates, which are more similar to humans, may be a better model to study tauopathies. For example, the common marmoset is poised as a nonhuman primate model for investigating the etiology of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. However, no biochemical studies of tau have been conducted in marmoset brains. Here, we investigated several important aspects of tau, including expression of different tau isoforms and its phosphorylation status, in the marmoset brain. We found that marmoset tau does not possess the ""primate unique motif"" in its N-terminal domain. We also discovered that the tau isoform expression pattern in marmosets is more similar to that of mice than of humans, with adult marmoset brains expressing only four-repeat tau isoforms as in adult mice but unlike in adult human brains. Of note, tau in brains of marmoset newborns was phosphorylated at several sites associated with AD pathology. However, in adult marmoset brains, much of this phosphorylation was lost, except for Ser-202 and Ser-404 phosphorylation. These results reveal key features of tau expression and phosphorylation in the marmoset brain, a potentially useful non-human primate model of neurodegenerative diseases."	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31171723	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31171723	Alzheimer	-8190931845319543363

We measured the daily tlr4 and grp78 RNA expression levels in peripheral blood of septic patients, immediately after admission to intensive care, and modeled these RNA values with a sine damping function. We obtained negative correlations between the transcription of tlr4 and grp78 RNA in the survivor group. In contrast, such relation is lost in the deceased patients.

We hypothesize that proper repair of neural DSBs via C-NHEJ or other end-joining pathways is critical for neural functionality and homeostasis over time and that improper DSB repair could contribute to complex psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we summarize various findings made by our laboratory and others over the years that support this hypothesis. This evidence includes, most recently, our discovery of a set of genes, of which most serve neural functions, that can serve as targets of recurrent DSBs in primary neural stem and progenitor cells.

Antipsychotic drugs show good bioavailability in the brain, and some of them have exhibited anticancer effects in several cancer types. In this study, we investigated the potential of repurposing fluphenazine hydrochloride (Flu) for the treatment of TNBC and the brain metastases. Our data showed that Flu inhibited survival of metastatic TNBC cells. It induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and promoted mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis 	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	30949404	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30949404	flu	-3015446245469915661

The by-products of solid waste deposited in a landfill has adverse effects on the surrounding environment and humans living closer to landfill sites. This study sought to test the hypothesis that the deposition of waste on landfill has an impact on the surrounding environment and residents living closer to it. This was achieved by evaluating the perception of the respondents drawn from people living close (100-500 m) and far (1-2 km) from the landfill site, concerning environmental issues, health problems, and life satisfaction. Results from the study showed that 78% of participants living closer to the landfill site indicated serious contamination of air quality evident from bad odours linked to the landfill site. Illnesses such as flu, eye irritation and weakness of the body were frequently reported by participants living closer to the landfill than those living far from the landfill. More than half of the participants (56%) living closer to the landfill indicated fear of their health in the future. Thus, the participants living closer to the landfill site were less satisfied with the location of their community with respect to the landfill, than those living far from the landfill site. Therefore, the need for a landfill gas (LFG) utilisation system, proper daily covering of waste and odour diluting agents are necessary to reduce the problems of the residents living closer to the landfill site.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31208082	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208082	flu	6428429126612898364

Sarcoma is a rare tumor with more than 50 histologic subtypes. Patients with advanced sarcoma have a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib, an oral vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 inhibitor, as salvage treatment for advanced bone and soft tissue sarcomas. From May 2017 to July 2018, a prospective, open-label, nonrandomized, clinical trial of apatinib was carried out in selected patients with advanced sarcoma. After apatinib dosing, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate, disease control rate, and treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were reviewed and evaluated. Patients were administered apatinib for at least 1 month. Median follow-up time was 6.00 months (1-13 months). The median PFS was 7.88 months, with the longest PFS of 13 months observed in a patient with epithelial sarcoma. The 3-month PFS rate was 66.44%. The median OS was 11.64 months with significant differences observed based on disease subtypes. Four patients achieved a partial response, and 36 patients achieved stable disease. The objective response rate was 8.88% (4/45), and the disease control rate was 88.89% (40/45). The most common grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs were hypertension (12.50%), hand-foot syndrome (6.67%), diarrhea (12.50%), fatigue (6.25%), and proteinuria (14.29%). One drug-related severe AE of thrombocytopenia (21×10/l) occurred 2 months after therapy. Apatinib treatment in our study exhibited objective efficacy in PFS, OS, and manageable toxicity in patients with advanced sarcoma. This result supports future randomized controlled trials to further define apatinib activity in stage IV sarcomas.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31305297	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305297	Diarrhea	3989649621607163677

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been reported to be decreased, increased, or not changed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and related transgenic mouse models. These disparate findings may relate to differences in disease stage, or the presence of seizures, which are associated with AD and can stimulate neurogenesis. In this study, we investigate a transgenic mouse model of AD that exhibits seizures similarly to AD patients and find that neurogenesis is increased in early stages of disease, as spontaneous seizures became evident, but is decreased below control levels as seizures recur. Treatment with the antiseizure drug levetiracetam restores neurogenesis and improves performance in a neurogenesis-associated spatial discrimination task. Our results suggest that seizures stimulate, and later accelerate the depletion of, the hippocampal neural stem cell pool. These results have implications for AD as well as any disorder accompanied by recurrent seizures, such as epilepsy.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31242408	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31242408	Alzheimer	6514150672874342131
2073	2073	324	The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India	Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning: The Future of Medicine and Medical Practice.	"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and access to ""Big Data"" together with the evolving techniques in biotechnology will change the medical practice a big way. Many diseases such as type II diabetes will no longer be considered as a single disease. Many familiar cancers such as cancer of liver or pancreas will have hundreds of subtypes whose management will be very different. The way we think about diseases will change. It will no longer be possible for clinicians to make a diagnosis, remember the names of diseases, the names of drugs or management protocols without the help of computers. As computer intelligence becomes more important than human intelligence in deciding diagnosis and treatment there will be a paradigm in the role of doctors. Internet, computers and social media will become more important than individuals in decision making. As a result, medicine will go more and more egalitarian (""wiki"") with increasing community participation in health decision making and management. A socialistic pattern will evolve over time globally as an adaptive reaction to the pressures put by artificial intelligence. This is because the individual differences in knowledge or intellect between human beings will become less apparent compared to the super powers of artificial intelligence. Qualities which are unique for humans such as compassion, empathy and emotional care will decide the professional success of future physicians even more than today. Today we are using artificial intelligence in diagnosis and prediction to help clinicians. Clinical algorithms and human experience cannot be replaced by machines. It will take many years to completely merge or replace humans with machines. However, we need to modify our medical education system in order to prepare the medical community and sensitize the society well in advance for a smooth transition."	2019	eng	Journal Article	India	31309802	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309802	diabetes	-5847687782206566321

Much of the AI work in healthcare is focused around disease prediction in clinical settings, which is an important application that has yet to deliver in earnest. However, there are other fundamental aspects like helping patients and care teams interact and communicate in efficient and meaningful ways, which could deliver quadruple-aim improvements. After heart disease and cancer, preventable medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States. The largest subset of medical errors is medication error. Providing the right treatment plan for patients includes knowledge about their current medications and drug allergies, an often challenging task. The widespread growth of prescribing and consuming medications has increased the need for applications that support medication reconciliation. We show a deep-learning application that can help reduce avoidable errors with their attendant risk, i.e., correctly identifying prescription medication, which is currently a tedious and error-prone task. We demonstrate prescription-pill identification from mobile images in the NIH NLM Pill Image Recognition Challenge dataset. Our application recognizes the correct pill within the top-5 results at 94% accuracy, which compares favorably to the original competition winner at 83.3% for top-5 under comparable, though not identical configurations. The Institute of Medicine claims that better use of information technology can be an important step in reducing medication errors. Therefore, we believe that a more immediate impact of AI in healthcare will occur with a seamless integration of AI into clinical workflows, readily addressing the quadruple aim of healthcare.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31304359	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304359	heart+disease	-908505899495735224

The aim of our study was to identify the cardiovascular risk factors present in patients with left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD), which influenced the progression of these patients in both percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). We performed a clinical observational descriptive study in which, during three years, we followed the evolution of 81 patients who were diagnosed with left main coronary artery disease and who were treated either by interventional revascularization by stent implantation, by surgical revascularization by performing an aortic-coronary bypass. In our study the risk factors according to which the evolution of the patients was observed were represented by diabetes, smoking, age and gender. The primary endpoint was mortality from any cause and other clinical endpoints were the reduction of left ventricular ejection fraction, symptomatic ischemic heart disease manifested by angina pectoris, non-procedural myocardial infarction or need for repeated revascularization. In our study diabetes was the risk factor that negatively influenced the evolution of patients with LMCAD treated either by PCI or by CABG for the most part, followed by smoking, male gender and age over 65 years.	2019	eng	Case Reports	Romania	31297258	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297258	smoking	4333668738649701866

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is given to newborns soon after birth. BCG vaccine overdose has been rarely reported. Here we report the outcome of newborns who accidently received high dose BCG at a tertiary care hospital, Karachi. We reviewed records of 26 newborns, who accidentally received intradermal high dose BCG, used for the treatment of urinary bladder cancers and 80 times higher dose than the BCG used for routine vaccination. The incident happened from 14-16th April, 2016 at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. Analysis was carried out using SPSS. A total of 23/26(88.5%) newborns were followed for atleast 3 months and 11/26 (42.3%) were followed for atleast one year. 13/26 (50%) were male. All 26 patients were prescribed isoniazid and rifampicin for 3 months. 3/26 (11.5%) were lost to follow-up before completion of anti-tuberculous drugs (ATT). Lesions at the BCG site were observed in 16/26 (61.5%) infants, of which 15 (93.8%) had a papule, 3 (18.8%) developed a pustule, 3 (18.8%) had skin induration and 2 (12.5%) had skin erythema. Axillary lymphadenopathy was observed in 1/26 (3.8%) patient. Coagulation was deranged in 3/26 (11.5%) of babies. Intracranial bleeding was observed in 1/26 (3.8%) case. Localized skin lesions were the most common adverse events. None of them developed clinical tuberculosis. Chemoprophylaxis for inadvertent high dose BCG administration should be given for atleast 3 months. Furthermore, vigilant follow-up, transparency and disclosure are the vital steps in the management of any medical error.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31291329	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291329	tuberculosis	-310216403933861245

Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) is a chronic pain condition with modest response to pharmacotherapy. Participation in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) leads to improvements in pain-related outcomes but the mechanisms of change are unknown. The present study examined the mediators and moderators of change in 62 patients with PDPN who participated in a randomized controlled trial comparing MBSR to waitlist. Changes in mindfulness and pain catastrophizing were tested simultaneously as mediators. Increased mindfulness mediated the association between participation in MBSR and improved pain severity, pain interference, and the physical component of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 3 months later. The mediation effect of pain catastrophizing was not significant. Linear moderated trends were also found. Post-hoc moderated mediation analyses suggested that MBSR patients with longer histories of diabetes might increase their mindfulness levels more, which in turn leads to improved pain severity and physical HRQoL. These results allow for a deeper understanding of pathways by which MBSR benefits patients with PDPN.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31309355	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309355	diabetes	-6893108632164641498

Background Studies on the determinants of carotid intima-media thickness ( CIMT ), a marker of sub-clinical atherosclerosis, mostly come from white, Asian, and diasporan black populations. We present CIMT data from sub-Saharan Africa, which is experiencing a rising burden of cardiovascular diseases and infectious diseases. Methods and Results The H3 (Human Hereditary and Health) in Africa's AWI-Gen (African-Wits-INDEPTH partnership for Genomic) study is a cross-sectional study conducted in adults aged 40 to 60 years from Burkina Faso, Kenya, Ghana, and South Africa. Cardiovascular disease risk and ultrasonography of the CIMT of right and left common carotids were measured. Multivariable linear and mixed-effect multilevel regression modeling was applied to determine factors related to CIMT. Data included 8872 adults (50.8% men), mean age of 50±6 years with age- and sex-adjusted mean (±SE) CIMT of 640±123μm. Participants from Ghana and Burkina Faso had higher CIMT compared with other sites. Age (β = 6.77, 95%CI [6.34-7.19]), body mass index (17.6[12.5-22.8]), systolic blood pressure (7.52[6.21-8.83]), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (5.08[2.10-8.06]) and men (10.3[4.75- 15.9]) were associated with higher CIMT. Smoking was associated with higher CIMT in men. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-12.2 [-17.9- -6.41]), alcohol consumption (-13.5 [-19.1--7.91]) and HIV (-8.86 [-15.7--2.03]) were inversely associated with CIMT. Conclusions Given the rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases risk factors in sub-Saharan Africa, atherosclerotic diseases may become a major pan-African epidemic unless preventive measures are taken particularly for prevention of hypertension, obesity, and smoking. HIV -specific studies are needed to fully understand the association between HIV and CIMT in sub-Saharan Africa.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31304842	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304842	HIV	5518462222339671372

Recent studies have revealed that the antimalarial drug artemether has antidiabetic effects. To identify potential effects on type 1 DKD in the present study, mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes were treated with artemether. Treatment reduced urinary excretion of albumin and tubular injury biomarkers, increased serum albumin and total protein levels, and attenuated renal hypertrophy. In addition, artemether treatment prevented hyperglycemia, raised serum insulin levels, and restored glucagon/insulin and somatostatin/insulin ratios in islets. We found that artemether improved mitochondrial function and regulated redox balance in kidney. These results demonstrate that artemether provides renal protection in type 1 diabetes mellitus, which may be due to improved mitochondrial function.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31312396	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312396	diabetes	4234941042749452539

In sporadic and dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease (AD), aggregation of both tau and α-synuclein may occur in neurons. Aggregates of either protein occur separately or coexist in the same neuron. It is not known whether the coaggregation of tau and α-synuclein in dominantly inherited AD occurs in association with specific mutations of the APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 genes. The aim of this study was to provide the first characterization of the neuropathologic phenotype associated with the PSEN1 p.A396T mutation in a man who was clinically diagnosed as having AD, but for whom the PSEN1 mutation was found postmortem. The proband, who was 56 years old when cognitive impairment first manifested, died at 67 years of age. Neuropathologically, 3 proteinopathies were present in the brain. Widespread α-synuclein-immunopositive neuronal inclusions suggested a diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), while severe and widespread tau and amyloid-β pathologies confirmed the clinical diagnosis of AD. Immunohistochemistry revealed the coexistence of tau and α-synuclein aggregates in the same neuron. Neuropathologic and molecular studies in brains of carriers of the PSEN1 p.A396T mutation or other PSEN1 or PSEN2 mutations associated with the coexistence of DLBD and AD are needed to clarify whether tau and α-synuclein proteinopathies occur independently or whether a relationship exists between α-synuclein and tau that might explain the mechanisms of coaggregation.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31165862	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31165862	Alzheimer	8169351562924200055

Lack of insulin or insulin resistance (IR) plays a central role in diabetes mellitus and makes diabetics prone to acute ischemic heart disease (AIHD). It has likewise been found that many cancer patients, including prostate cancer patients die of AIHD. Previously it has been delineated from our laboratory that dermcidin could induce anomalous platelet aggregation in AIHD and also impaired nitric oxide and insulin activity and furthermore dermcidin was also found in a few types of cancer patients. To determine the role of this protein in prostatic malignancy a retrospective case-control study was conducted and blood was collected from prostate cancer patients and healthy normal volunteers. So, we measured the level of dermcidin protein and analyze the IR by HOMA score calculation. Nitric oxide was measured by methemoglobin method. HDL, HbA1c, BMI, hs-cTroponin-T were measured for the validation of the patients' status in the presence of DCN-2.

2102	2102	60	Aging cell	Changes in presynaptic calcium signalling accompany age-related deficits in hippocampal LTP and cognitive impairment.	The loss of cognitive function accompanying healthy aging is not associated with extensive or characteristic patterns of cell death, suggesting it is caused by more subtle changes in synaptic properties. In the hippocampal CA1 region, long-term potentiation requires stronger stimulation for induction in aged rats and mice and long-term depression becomes more prevalent. An age-dependent impairment of postsynaptic calcium homeostasis may underpin these effects. We have examined changes in presynaptic calcium signalling in aged mice using a transgenic mouse line (SyG37) that expresses a genetically encoded calcium sensor in presynaptic terminals. SyG37 mice showed an age-dependent decline in cognitive abilities in behavioural tasks that require hippocampal processing including the Barnes maze, T-maze and object location but not recognition tests. The incidence of LTP was significantly impaired in animals over 18 months of age. These effects of aging were accompanied by a persistent increase in resting presynaptic calcium, an increase in the presynaptic calcium signal following Schaffer collateral fibre stimulation, an increase in postsynaptic fEPSP slope and a reduction in paired-pulse facilitation. These effects were not caused by synapse proliferation and were of presynaptic origin since they were evident in single presynaptic boutons. Aged synapses behaved like younger ones when the extracellular calcium concentration was reduced. Raising extracellular calcium had little effect on aged synapses but altered the properties of young synapses into those of their aged counterparts. These effects can be readily explained by an age-dependent change in the properties or numbers of presynaptic calcium channels.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31310431	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310431	aging	5849490334294127641

This study investigated the feasibility of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program for a female patient with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), depression, and anxiety, to improve her mood and quality of life. The program comprised of eight 30-minute weekly sessions with interventions such as behavioral activation, relaxation, and cognitive reconstruction, in which the patient's caregiver also participated. An assessment evaluating the patient's condition were conducted before and immediately after the intervention. After 3 and 12 months, the caregiver reported the patient's behavioral and psychological symptoms using self-reported psychological scales concerning depression, anxiety, and quality of life. CBT helped to improve the patient's mood and quality of life in the short term (3 months). However, the results were not sustained in the long term (12 months). These results show that CBT could be a feasible non-pharmacological treatment option and provide preliminary support for wider application of CBT in Japan, even though it improved psychological symptoms in only one patient with MCI in the short term. Therefore, a CBT program should be tailored to meet the needs of patients with MCI and dementia, and regular follow-up sessions should be conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the program and the patient's mental health improvement.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Japan	31308314	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308314	depression	895442114569096829

2108	2108	597	Journal of clinical hypertension (Greenwich, Conn.)	A cardiovascular risk prediction model for older people: Development and validation in a primary care population.	Cardiovascular risk prediction is mainly based on traditional risk factors that have been validated in middle-aged populations. However, associations between these risk factors and cardiovascular disease (CVD) attenuate with increasing age. Therefore, for older people the authors developed and internally validated risk prediction models for fatal and non-fatal CVD, (re)evaluated the predictive value of traditional and new factors, and assessed the impact of competing risks of non-cardiovascular death. Post hoc analyses of 1811 persons aged 70-78 year and free from CVD at baseline from the preDIVA study (Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular care, 2006-2015), a primary care-based trial that included persons free from dementia and conditions likely to hinder successful long-term follow-up, were performed. In 2017-2018, Cox-regression analyses were performed for a model including seven traditional risk factors only, and a model to assess incremental predictive ability of the traditional and eleven new factors. Analyses were repeated accounting for competing risk of death, using Fine-Gray models. During an average of 6.2 years of follow-up, 277 CVD events occurred. Age, sex, smoking, and type 2 diabetes mellitus were traditional predictors for CVD, whereas total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were not. Of the eleven new factors, polypharmacy and apathy symptoms were predictors. Discrimination was moderate (concordance statistic 0.65). Accounting for competing risks resulted in slightly smaller predicted absolute risks. In conclusion, we found, SBP, HDL, and total cholesterol no longer predict CVD in older adults, whereas polypharmacy and apathy symptoms are two new relevant predictors. Building on the selected risk factors in this study may improve CVD prediction in older adults and facilitate targeting preventive interventions to those at high risk.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31294917	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31294917	smoking	1252762949661329700

The purpose of this study was to examine the association between oral health literacy, preventive orientation and behaviors, and chronic medical conditions-specifically, hypertension and diabetes. A cross-sectional study was conducted with dental school patients attending the dental clinics in Los Angeles, California, and Baltimore, Maryland. Their health literacy levels were measured using the short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (Short-TOFHLA) and the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine and Dentistry (REALM-D). The medical history and existing medical conditions-specifically, hypertension and diabetes status-were extracted from patient health history and electronic records. Ten items were asked about preventive behaviors (e.g., brushing teeth in evening, smoking, exercise, drinking soda) and 3 preventive health services (dental checkup, flu shot, medical checkup). Six locus of control items were asked (e.g., good health is a matter of good fortune, what happens to my health is God's will). Out of 793 subjects, 221 had a documented history of hypertension, 88 with diabetes. There was an association between Short-TOFHLA scores and both diabetes and hypertension, but after controlling for sociodemographic and preventive variables, the association was no longer significant. In multivariate analysis, women, people with at least some college, Asians or non-Hispanic Whites, younger people, those who spoke English as a child, those who sought health information from the Internet or health care professionals, and those who smoked reported lower utilization of preventive health services, and those who had less locus of control reported higher Short-TOFHLA scores. There were no significant differences in mean REALM-D scores between patients who had hypertension or diabetes versus not having the condition. Multivariate models showed that people with higher REALM-D scores had at least some college, were other race/ethnicity or non-Hispanic White, spoke English as a child, and sought health information via the Internet. Knowledge Transfer Statement: The results of this study show that dental school patients exhibit a range of health literacy abilities and preventive behaviors, and health literacy measures positively correlated with some preventive behaviors but not others. Dental schools receive a significant number of patients with chronic diseases, and students should be educated to use effective patient communication skills to reinforce positive health behaviors among these patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	30938606	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30938606	flu	9054050762437897017

With improved understanding of molecular pathways that promote hepatic vascular remodeling, vasoconstriction, and sinusoidal capillarization potential vascular targets for the treatment of portal hypertension have been identified. Inhibition of vascular endothelial and platelet-derived growth factors-driven angiogenesis has been shown to reduce portal pressure and decrease hepatic inflammation. Angiopoietin/Tie signaling represents additional promising vascular targets in liver disease. The eNOS-NO-sGC-cGMP pathway modulates sinusoidal vasoconstriction and capillarization. Nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists decrease intrahepatic vascular resistance by inhibition of fibrogenesis and sinusoidal remodeling. Statins ameliorate endothelial dysfunction, decrease portal pressure, and reduce fibrogenesis. Anticoagulation with low-molecular heparin or anti-Xa inhibitors improved portal hypertension by deactivation of hepatic stellate cells and potentially via reduction of sinusoidal microthrombosis. This review summarizes important vascular targets for treatment of portal hypertension that have shown promising results in experimental studies.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31315135	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315135	Cirrhosis	5998661158461710046

Total free amino acids of dry-aged pork cuts were also significantly (p<0.05) higher than those of wet-aged pork cuts after 21 days of aging. Consequently, umami intensity of dry-aged pork cuts increased more rapidly and the values were significantly (p<0.05) higher than those of wet-aged pork during 21 days of aging. Results suggested that the better palatability of dry-aged pork cuts might be due to higher umami intensity in relation to higher contents of inosine, hypoxanthine, and free amino acids.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Korea (South)	31304467	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304467	aging	-3959242148361340089

Migraine appears to be the most common neurological syndrome in primary care. Pain in migraine is mediated by the release of inflammatory mediators at the level of nerves and blood vessels. The antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of vitamin D in the central nervous system suggest that deficiency of this vitamin can be involved in migraine. Moreover, low serum levels of vitamin D correlates with a higher incidence of chronic pain, including migraine and in co-administered with anti-migraine treatment reduces the frequency of migraine attacks. We report a 46-year old woman affected by migraine, anxiety and mild depressive mood (MSQ score: 24; BDI score: 34; VAS score: 8) that partially improved with pregabalin treatment (VAS: 5). Laboratory findings documented low serum levels of vitamin D (25-hydroxy-vitamin D: 12 ng/mL; normal range: 20-100 ng/mL; 1-25 di-hydroxy-vitamin D: 19 ng/mL, normal range: 25-66 ng/mL). The treatment with 10,000 UI vitamin D during pregabalin therapy induced an improvement of clinical symptoms (pain, anxiety and depression) and of the quality of life. This case report suggest that in chronic migraine patient with anxiety and mild mood depression in treatment with pregabalin a supplementation of vitamin D improvement the clinical symptoms of migraine and a modulation of inhibitoy synaptic neurotransmission may explain this effect in our migraine patient.	2019	eng	Case Reports	United States	31308581	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308581	depression	-1137602700803601559

While headache is the most prominent feature of migraine, a host of symptoms affecting many physiological functions are also observed before, during, and after an attack. Furthermore, migraineurs are heterogeneous and have a wide range of responses to migraine therapies. The recent approval of calcitonin gene-related-peptide based therapies has opened up the treatment of migraine and generated a renewed interest in migraine research and discovery. Ongoing advances in migraine research have identified a number of other promising therapeutic targets for this disorder. In this review, we highlight emergent treatments within the following biological systems: pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptdie, 2 non-mu opioid receptors that have low abuse liability - the delta and kappa opioid receptors, orexin, and nitric oxide-based therapies. Multiple mechanisms have been identified in the induction and maintenance of migraine symptoms; and this divergent set of targets have highly distinct biological effects. Increasing the mechanistic diversity of the migraine tool box will lead to more treatment options and better patient care.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31291018	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291018	headache	6340108943344143104

To investigate effects of berberine exerts on A20 expression and regulation of intestinal epithelial tight junctions via the TNF-α-NF-κB-MLCK pathway in Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D). C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and A20 IEC-KO mice (48 each) were randomly divided into normal control (NC), model control (MC), rifaximin and berberine groups (12 mice per group). An experimental model of IBS-D was established using 4% acetic acid and evaluated by haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. rifaximin and berberine mice were treated with rifaximin and berberine, respectively. Intestinal epithelial space of WT berberine mice improved more than A20 IEC-KO berberine mice compared to MC mice. WT berberine mice exhibited greater expression of A20 compared with MC mice(P < 0.01). TNF-α, NF-kB p65, MLCK, MLC, TRAF6 and RIP1 levels in A20 IEC-KO and WT berberine mice were all decreased compared to MC mice(P all<0.05). NF-κB p65, MLCK and TRAF6 levels were increased in A20 IEC-KO berberine mice as compared to WT berberine mice (P all<0.05). Intestinal epithelial levels of occludin, claudin-1, ZO-1 and F-actin increased in all berberine mice (P all<0.01-0.05), while occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1 levels were lower in A20 IEC-KO berberine mice(P < 0.05). Berberine downregulates abnormal activation of the TNF-α-NF-κB-MLCK pathway by upregulating expression of A20 in a mouse model of IBS-D, thereby protecting intestinal epithelial tight junctions and repairing the damage IBS-D causes to the intestinal epithelial barrier.	2019	eng	Journal Article	France	31306972	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306972	Diarrhea	5312357518363318341

Recurrent tuberculosis (TB) after successful TB treatment occurs due to endogenous reactivation (relapse) or exogenous reinfection. We revisited the conclusions of relapse in a high TB incidence setting that were drawn on the basis of IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis in a large retrospective cohort study in suburban Cape Town, South Africa. Using whole genome sequencing (WGS), we undertook pair-wise genome comparison of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains cultured from diagnostic sputum samples collected at the index and recurrent TB episode for 25 recurrent TB cases who had been classified as relapse based on identical DNA fingerprint patterns in the earlier study. We found that paired strain genome sequences were identical or showed minimal variant differences in 22 of 25 recurrent TB cases, consistent with relapse. One showed 20 variant differences, suggestive of exogenous reinfection. Two of the 25 had mixed infections, each with the index episode strain detected as the dominant strain at recurrence in one of these patients, the minority strain harboured drug-resistance conferring mutations (rpoB, katG). In conclusion, our study highlights the additional value of WGS for investigating recurrent TB in settings with high infection pressure and closely related circulating strains, where the extent of re- and mixed infection may be underestimated.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31276801	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31276801	tuberculosis	-5686522658459155544

The aim of our study was to assess risk factors associated with vitamin D deficiency among HIV-1-infected patients on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). A retrospective, case-control study was conducted to assess risk factors associated with vitamin D deficiency among HIV-1-infected adults on stable cART. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25-OH vitamin D concentration <30 ng/mL. A total of 195 patients (77% males, mean age 49.2 years) were enrolled into the study: 98 subjects with vitamin D deficiency (cases) and 97 with normal vitamin D serum concentration (controls). The mean serum concentration + standard deviation (SD) of vitamin D was 18.2 + 6.7 ng/mL among cases and 39.6 + 13.4 ng/mL among controls. Current cART including tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (OR 1.65; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.94), osteoporosis (OR 1.78; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.09), males who have sex with males (MSM) risk category (OR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.19 to 2.21), chronic hepatitis C (OR 1.44; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.86), previous or current cancer (OR 1.47; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.79), metabolic syndrome (OR 2.57; 95% CI, 1.96 to 2.98), and hepatic steatosis (OR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.17 to 2.05) were significant associated with an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency. On the other hand, current CD4+ lymphocyte count >600 cells/mmc and current HIV RNA <20 copies/mL were significantly associated with a lower risk of vitamin D deficiency. In our case-control study, vitamin D deficiency is associated with TDF exposure, osteoporosis, and metabolic disturbances.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Italy	31305932	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305932	HIV	-4866987227632887920

We report an unusual case of a dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) presenting as acute neck pain and quadripareis in a 55-year-old previously healthy man. Imaging was suspicious for cervicomedullary venous thrombosis and angiography failed to show evidence of arteriovenous malformation or dAVF. The patient was started on warfarin for a presumed cervicomedullary venous thrombosis and there was a significant clinical improvement. However, 3 weeks later, the symptoms recurred and repeat angiography revealed a dAVF fed by a posterior branch of the left middle meningeal artery draining into the posterior fossa vein. We postulated that warfarin caused recanalisation of the previously thrombosed venous pouch allowing for angiographic discovery and treatment of the dAVF. The dAVF was embolised with onyx resulting in the complete obliteration of the dAVF and symptomatic improvement. Although rare, some dAVF can be concealed or disappear on angiography due to thrombosis of the draining vein and warfarin can lead to recanalisation.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31296639	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296639	headache	-3450690190989108770

2137	2137	123	Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE	Identification of Nucleolar Factors During HIV-1 Replication Through Rev Immunoprecipitation and Mass Spectrometry.	The HIV-1 infectious cycle requires viral protein interactions with host factors to facilitate viral replication, packaging, and release. The infectious cycle further requires the formation of viral/host protein complexes with HIV-1 RNA to regulate the splicing and enable nucleocytoplasmic transport. The HIV-1 Rev protein accomplishes the nuclear export of HIV-1 mRNAs through multimerization with intronic cis-acting targets - the Rev response element (RRE). A nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) exists within the COOH-terminus of the Rev arginine-rich motif (ARM), allowing the accumulation of Rev/RRE complexes in the nucleolus. Nucleolar factors are speculated to support the HIV-1 infectious cycle through various other functions in addition to mediating mRNA-independent nuclear export and splicing. We describe an immunoprecipitation method of wild-type (WT) Rev in comparison to Rev nucleolar mutations (deletion and single-point Rev-NoLS mutations) in the presence of HIV-1 replication for mass spectrometry. Nucleolar factors implicated in the nucleocytoplasmic transport (nucleophosmin B23 and nucleolin C23), as well as cellular splicing factors, lose interaction with Rev in the presence of Rev-NoLS mutations. Various other nucleolar factors, such as snoRNA C/D box 58, are identified to lose interaction with Rev mutations, yet their function in the HIV-1 replication cycle remain unknown. The results presented here demonstrate the use of this approach for the identification of viral/host nucleolar factors that maintain the HIV-1 infectious cycle. The concepts used in this approach are applicable to other viral and disease models requiring the characterization of understudied pathways.	2019	eng	Video-Audio Media	United States	31305524	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305524	HIV	-1255189867397298842

Exquisite regulation of energy homeostasis protects from nutrient deprivation but causes metabolic dysfunction upon nutrient excess. In human and murine adipose tissue, the accumulation of ligands of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) accompanies obesity, implicating this receptor in energy metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that mice bearing global- or adipocyte-specific deletion of Ager, the gene encoding RAGE, display superior metabolic recovery after fasting, a cold challenge, or high-fat feeding. The RAGE-dependent mechanisms were traced to suppression of protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of its key targets, hormone-sensitive lipase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, upon β-adrenergic receptor stimulation-processes that dampen the expression and activity of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and thermogenic programs. This work identifies the innate role of RAGE as a key node in the immunometabolic networks that control responses to nutrient supply and cold challenges, and it unveils opportunities to harness energy expenditure in environmental and metabolic stress.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31315054	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315054	obesity	-6463637573325658465

"Ischemic stroke represents the 2nd leading cause of death worldwide and the leading cause for long-term disabilities, for which no cure exists. After stroke, neurons are frequently lost in the infarct core. On the other hand, other cells such as astrocytes become reactive and proliferative, disrupting the neurovascular unit in the lesioned area, especially in the aged brain. Therefore, restoring the balance between neurons and nonneuronal cells within the perilesional area is crucial for post stroke recovery. In addition, the aged post stroke brain mounts a fulminant proliferative astroglial response leading to the buildup of gliotic scars that prevent neural regeneration. Therefore, ""melting"" glial scars has been attempted for decades, albeit with little success. Alternative strategies include transforming inhibitory gliotic tissue into an environment conducive to neuronal regeneration and axonal growth by genetic conversion of astrocytes into neurons. The latter idea has gained momentum following the discovery that in vivo direct lineage reprogramming in the adult mammalian brain is a feasible strategy for reprogramming nonneuronal cells into neurons. This exciting new technology emerged as a new approach to circumvent cell transplantation for stroke therapy. However, the potential of this new methodology has not been yet tested to improve restoration of structure and function in the hostile environment caused by the fulminant inflammatory reaction in the brains of aged animals."	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31300928	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300928	aging	957332268361319692

Hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy has the unique ability to detect real-time metabolic changes in vivo owing to its high sensitivity compared with thermal MR and high specificity compared with other metabolic imaging methods. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of hyperpolarized MR spectroscopy for quantification of liver pyruvate metabolism during a hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic clamp in mice. Hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate was used for in vivo MR spectroscopy of liver pyruvate metabolism in mice. Mice were divided into two groups: i) non-stimulated 5-hour fasted mice and ii) hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic clamped mice. During clamp conditions, insulin and donor blood were administered at a constant rate whereas glucose were infused to maintain isoglycemia. When steady state was reached, insulin-stimulated mice were rapidly infused with hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate for real-time tracking of the dynamic distribution of metabolic derivatives from pyruvate, such as [1-13C]lactate, [1-13C]alanine, and [13C]bicarbonate. Isotopomer analysis of plasma glucose confirmed 13C-incorporation from [1-13C]pyruvate into glucose was increased in fasted mice compared with insulin-stimulated mice, demonstrating an increased gluconeogenesis in fasted mice. The AUC ratios for [1-13C]alanine/[1-13C]pyruvate (38.2%), [1-13C]lactate/[1-13C]pyruvate (41.8%), and [13C]bicarbonate/[1-13C]pyruvate (169%) all increased significantly during insulin stimulation. Hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate can be used for in vivo MR spectroscopy of liver pyruvate metabolism during hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic clamp conditions. Under these conditions, insulin decreased gluconeogenesis and increased [1-13C]alanine, [1-13C]lactate, and [13C]bicarbonate after a [1-13C]pyruvate bolus. This application of in vivo spectroscopy has the potential to identify impairments in specific metabolic pathways in the liver associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31311004	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311004	obesity	-1291869519847635026

Therefore, CASC2c may serve as a new biomarker and therapeutic target in the diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31300295	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300295	smoking	1060159005880386235

To investigate the efficacy of eltrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis C, a phase II, single-arm, open-label study with a 9-week pre-antiviral phase was conducted, followed by a 48-week antiviral phase and a 24-week follow-up phase. The proportion of patients who achieved a platelet count threshold, the proportion of patients who maintained a platelet count >50,000/µl, sustained virological response (SVR) rates and safety parameters were evaluated. Of the 45 enrolled patients (median age, 59 years; median platelet count, 63,000/µl; 98% with Child-Pugh class A), 43 (96%) achieved the platelet count threshold during the pre-antiviral phase. A total of 13 patients (29%) experienced ≥1 adverse event (AE), of which headache and vomiting were the most common, and 41 patients (mostly receiving eltrombopag 12.5 mg or 25 mg) entered the antiviral phase, of which 36 (88%) maintained the platelet count threshold; no patient platelet count decreased below 25,000/µl. Nine patients (22%) achieved an SVR at the 24-week follow-up. Grade ≥3 AEs occurred in 25 patients (61%). A total of 8 serious AEs occurred in five patients (12%). No mortality, thromboembolic events (TEEs), or cataract progression were reported. Eltrombopag increased the platelet count in chronic hepatitis C virus-infected patients with cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia and enabled them to initiate and complete interferon-based antiviral therapy (NCT01636778; first submitted: July 05, 2012).	2019	eng	Journal Article	Greece	31258695	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31258695	headache	6472331784294749716

Adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) who are pregnant, or parenting, are an important but understudied group. This study explores the challenges in promoting the health of these adolescents and preventing onward transmission. We used existing semi-structured interview data from a 2014 study conducted among Kenyan ALHIV (ages 15-19), their family members, and local health staff to examine adolescent HIV-testing, disclosure, and treatment engagement, focusing on participants who were pregnant, had given birth, or had fathered a child. A total of 28 participant interviews were analyzed, including those conducted with nine ALHIV, four family members, and 15 HIV providers. Four adolescent participants were not in care at the time of their interview. Our analysis also included a transcript from a stakeholder meeting involving HIV providers and associated administrators, held to disseminate and garner feedback on, preliminary findings from the original study. Based on our analysis, adolescents frequently reported being alone during testing, experiencing fear and denial on receiving their results, and delaying disclosure to family and linkage to treatment. They also mentioned a lack of contraceptive counseling, with some reporting multiple pregnancies. Providers voiced misgivings and uncertainty about disclosing HIV diagnoses to minor adolescents without a family member present and reported severe shortages of personnel and resources to adequately serve ALHIV in rural clinics. These findings highlight gaps in services that limit adolescent engagement in HIV treatment prior to sexual debut and conceiving a child, and in PMTCT during and after pregnancy. Greater research attention is needed to address ALHIV reproductive health needs, improve linkage to HIV treatment, and prevent onward sexual transmission. Empirical ethics studies of current adolescent disclosure policies are also warranted to examine cultural and developmental appropriateness, and effectiveness in fostering support and engagement in HIV services.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31308586	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308586	HIV	9112765177685685246

On one side this is due to trends in population towards aging and obesity resulting in a higher prevalence of steatosis/steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. On the other side, inflammatory origin, especially due to viral hepatitis, is one of the primary reasons for diffuse liver disease. This chapter will describe the most common imaging features of hepatic metabolic and storage diseases, including overload with fat, iron, copper, and amyloid and diffuse neoplastic diseases. We also discuss focal and diffuse infectious and inflammatory hepatic diseases. Key imaging manifestations of fungal, granulomatous, parasitic, viral, and bacterial as well as the less common hepatic infections such as cat-scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis, and amebic disease are reviewed to avoid pitfalls in image interpretation. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides unique capabilities for noninvasive and quantitative characterization of liver tissue that rival the diagnostic utility of liver biopsies, also characteristic imaging findings with computed tomography (CT) that are useful in daily clinical routine will be discussed.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314369	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314369	aging	-6058152698516590252

2165	2165	19	Proceedings. Biological sciences	Risk alleles for tuberculosis infection associate with reduced immune reactivity in a wild mammalian host.	Integrating biological processes across scales remains a central challenge in disease ecology. Genetic variation drives differences in host immune responses, which, along with environmental factors, generates temporal and spatial infection patterns in natural populations that epidemiologists seek to predict and control. However, genetics and immunology are typically studied in model systems, whereas population-level patterns of infection status and susceptibility are uniquely observable in nature. Despite obvious causal connections, organizational scales from genes to host outcomes to population patterns are rarely linked explicitly. Here we identify two loci near genes involved in macrophage (phagocyte) activation and pathogen degradation that additively increase risk of bovine tuberculosis infection by up to ninefold in wild African buffalo. Furthermore, we observe genotype-specific variation in IL-12 production indicative of variation in macrophage activation. Here, we provide measurable differences in infection resistance at multiple scales by characterizing the genetic and inflammatory variation driving patterns of infection in a wild mammal.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31311473	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311473	tuberculosis	-8704908797766843570

Compared to control sites, participants at HITSystem sites described enhanced EID quality; HITSystem-generated texts informed them of result availability and retesting needs, provided cues-to-action for clinic attendance, and engendered opportunities for patient support. They described improved EID efficiency through shorter waiting periods for results and fewer hospital visits. Participants reported high satisfaction with EID and acceptability of text messages; however, modifications to ensure text delivery, increase repeat testing reminders, include low literacy content options, and provide encouraging messages were suggested.

2173	2173	40	Frontiers in aging neuroscience	Decoding the Role of Platelets and Related MicroRNAs in Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders.	Platelets are anucleate cells that circulate in blood and are essential components of the hemostatic system. During aging, platelet numbers decrease and their aggregation capacity is reduced. Platelet dysfunctions associated with aging can be linked to molecular alterations affecting several cellular systems that include cytoskeleton rearrangements, signal transduction, vesicular trafficking, and protein degradation. Age platelets may adopt a phenotype characterized by robust secretion of extracellular vesicles that could in turn account for about 70-90% of blood circulating vesicles. Interestingly these extracellular vesicles are loaded with messenger RNAs and microRNAs that may have a profound impact on protein physiology at the systems level. Age platelet dysfunction is also associated with accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Thereby understanding the mechanisms of aging in platelets as well as their age-dependent dysfunctions may be of interest when evaluating the contribution of aging to the onset of age-dependent pathologies, such as those affecting the nervous system. In this review we summarize the findings that link platelet dysfunctions to neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Huntington's Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. We discuss the role of platelets as drivers of protein dysfunctions observed in these pathologies, their association with aging and the potential clinical significance of platelets, and related miRNAs, as peripheral biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31312134	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312134	aging	8844011188151156774

Allergen immunotherapy is the only curative treatment for IgE-mediated allergic diseases in contrast to symptomatic treatment such as anti-histamine agents.

However, the major drawbacks of SCIT are necessity of repeated painful injections as well as the risk of severe systemic adverse reactions. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) was developed to resolve these issues. In Japan, Japanese cedar (JC) pollen SLIT-drop was developed initially for treatment of JC pollinosis, and approved for patients of 12 years of age and older in 2014. For adolescent and adult patients with HDM-allergic rhinitis, HDM SLIT-tablet was launched in 2015 and subsequently approved to be also available for pediatric patients (<12 years of age) in 2018. Moreover, JC pollen SLIT-tablet for JC pollinosis was approved in 2018 for all patients with no age limit.

The MmcO protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a membrane-associated multicopper oxidase. Its natural substrate(s) and its role in pathogenesis are not well characterized. A recent report proposes that MmcO contributes to copper resistance in M. tuberculosis during infection. We have expressed and reconstituted the active enzyme from inclusion bodies in E. coli. MmcO exhibits maximal activity against the experimental substrate 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) or ABTS, at pH 4. The enzyme also exhibits ferroxidase activity at pH 4. Most notable was the finding that MmcO is able to scavenge the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase enzyme system. This ROS scavenging activity of MmcO was also evident against ROS generated by THP-1 cells. We propose that MmcO protects M. tuberculosis during infection against ROS attack in addition to providing copper resistance to the pathogen.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31278055	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31278055	tuberculosis	1553114235264483780

2183	2183	337	Scientific reports	Global impact of diet and temperature over aquaculture of Octopus vulgaris paralarvae from a transcriptomic approach.	Common octopus, Octopus vulgaris, is an economically important cephalopod species. However, its rearing under captivity is currently challenged by massive mortalities previous to their juvenile stage due to nutritional and environmental factors. Dissecting the genetic basis and regulatory mechanism behind this mortality requires genomic background knowledge. A transcriptomic sequencing of 10 dph octopus paralarvae from different experimental conditions was constructed via RNA-seq. A total of 613,767,530 raw reads were filtered and de novo assembled into 363,527 contigs of which 82,513 were annotated in UniProt carrying also their GO and KEGG information. Differential gene expression analysis was carried out on paralarvae reared under different diet regimes and temperatures, also including wild paralarvae. Genes related to lipid metabolism exhibited higher transcriptional levels in individuals whose diet includes crustacean zoeas, which had an impact over their development and immune response capability. High temperature induces acclimation processes at the time that increase metabolic demands and oxidative stress. Wild individuals show an expression profile unexpectedly similar to Artemia fed individuals. Proteomic results support the hypothesis revealed by transcriptional analysis. The comparative study of the O. vulgaris transcriptomic profiles allowed the identification of genes that deserve to be further studied as candidates for biomarkers of development and health.

2186	2186	396	The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology	Leveraging -omics for asthma endotyping.	Asthma is a highly heterogeneous disease, often manifesting with wheeze, dyspnea, chest tightness, and cough as prominent symptoms. The eliciting factors, natural history, underlying molecular biology, and clinical management of asthma vary highly among affected subjects. Because of this variation, many efforts have gone into subtyping asthma. Endotypes are subtypes of disease based on distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms. Endotypes can be clinically useful because they organize our mechanistic understanding of heterogeneous diseases and can direct treatment toward modalities that are likely to be the most effective. Asthma endotyping can be shaped by clinical features, laboratory parameters, and/or -omics approaches. We discuss the application of -omics approaches, including transcriptomics, epigenomics, microbiomics, metabolomics, and proteomics, to asthma endotyping. -Omics approaches have provided supporting evidence for many existing endotyping paradigms and also suggested novel ways to conceptualize asthma endotypes. Although endotypes based on single -omics approaches are relatively common, their integrated multi-omics application to asthma endotyping has been more limited thus far. We discuss paths forward to integrate multi-omics with clinical features and laboratory parameters to achieve the goal of precise asthma endotypes.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31277743	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31277743	asthma	4241385837165861843

2189	2189	133	Journal of theoretical biology	Are we prepared for the next influenza pandemic? Lessons from modelling different preparedness policies against four pandemic scenarios.	"In the event of a novel influenza strain that is markedly different to the current strains circulating in humans, the population have little/no immunity and infection spreads quickly causing a global pandemic. Over the past century, there have been four major influenza pandemics: the 1918 pandemic (""Spanish Flu""), the 1957-58 pandemic (the ""Asian Flu""), the 1967-68 pandemic (the ""Hong Kong Flu"") and the 2009 pandemic (the ""Swine flu""). To inform planning against future pandemics, this paper investigates how different is the net-present value of employing pre-purchase and responsive- purchased vaccine programmes in presence and absence of anti-viral drugs to scenarios that resemble these historic influenza pandemics. Using the existing literature and in discussions with policy decision makers in the UK, we first characterised the four past influenza pandemics by their transmissibility and infection-severity. For these combinations of parameters, we then projected the net-present value of employing pre-purchase vaccine (PPV) and responsive-purchase vaccine (RPV) programmes in presence and absence of anti-viral drugs. To differentiate between PPV and RPV policies, we changed the vaccine effectiveness value and the time to when the vaccine is first available. Our results are ""heat-map"" graphs displaying the benefits of different strategies in pandemic scenarios that resemble historic influenza pandemics. Our results suggest that immunisation with either PPV or RPV in presence of a stockpile of effective antiviral drugs, does not have positive net-present value for all of the pandemic scenarios considered. In contrast, in the absence of effective antivirals, both PPV and RPV policies have positive net-present value across all the pandemic scenarios. Moreover, in all considered circumstances, vaccination was most beneficial if started sufficiently early and covered sufficiently large number of people. When comparing the two vaccine programmes, the RPV policy allowed a longer timeframe and lower coverage to attain the same benefit as the PPV policy. Our findings suggest that responsive-purchase vaccination policy has a bigger window of positive net-present value when employed against each of the historic influenza pandemic strains but needs to be rapidly available to maximise benefit. This is important for future planning as it suggests that future preparedness policies may wish to consider utilising timely (i.e. responsive-purchased) vaccines against emerging influenza pandemics."	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31059716	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31059716	flu	-3077386995956755130

Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) can stimulate cancer cell growth and invasion; however, the influence of bFGF blockade remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to explore the effects of bFGF blockade on the growth and invasion in A549 (high bFGF expression) and H2122 (low bFGF expression) lung cancer cells. We found that the blocking of bFGF by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody suppressed the growth of A549 cells but not of H2122 cells, as well as strongly induced the invasiveness of A549 cancer cells. Furthermore, bFGF blockade activated the AKT pathway and enhanced the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in A549 cells. These responses could be reversed by treatment with AKT inhibitor and siMMP-2, thus indicating the involvement of the AKT/MMP-2/VEGF-positive feedback loop. Finally, we confirmed that the anti-bFGF-induced invasion of cancer cells could be rescued by inhibiting the AKT/MMP-2/VEGF loop. Our results revealed that bFGF blockade suppresses cell growth but promotes cell invasion in lung cancer cells with high bFGF expression levels. Our data further reinforced the importance of the AKT/MMP-2/VEGF loop in regulating anti-bFGF-induced tumour cell invasion, and suggested the limitations of the bFGF-targeting strategy in lung cancer treatment.

2198	2198	233	Journal of sleep research	Longitudinal sleep efficiency in the elderly and its association with health.	The relationships between older age and sleep efficiency have traditionally been assessed using cross-sectional studies that ignore changes within individuals as they age. This research examines the determinants of sleep efficiency, the heterogeneity in an individual's sleep efficiency trajectory across a period of up to 27 years in later life and its associations with health. The University of Manchester Longitudinal Study of Cognition in Normal Healthy Old Age cohort (n = 6,375; age 42-94 years) was used in this study. Depression and health data were collected using self-report validated instruments (Cornell Medical Index, Beck Depression Inventory and Geriatric Depression Scale). Longitudinal sleep and sociodemographic data were collected using a study-specific self-report questionnaire. A mixed-effect model was performed for sleep efficiency with adjustments for time-invariant and time-variant predictors. Latent class analysis was used to demonstrate subgroups of sleep efficiency trajectories and associations between sleep efficiency clusters and health history of the participants were investigated. Older adults have decreased sleep efficiency over time, with 18.6% decline between 40 and 100 years of age. Three sleep efficiency trajectory clusters were identified: high (32%), medium (50%) and low sleep efficiency (18%). Belonging to the high sleep efficiency cluster was associated with having lower prevalence of hypertension, circulatory problems, general arthritis, breathing problems and recurrent episodes of depression compared to the low efficiency cluster. Overall, ageing decreases sleep efficiency. However, there are detectable subgroups of sleep efficiency that are related to prevalence of different diseases.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31313420	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313420	depression	-1755875383603052680

We investigated the relationship between living in a household that receives the Brazilian Income Transfer Program (Bolsa Família, in Portuguese - BF), a Brazilian conditional cash transfer program, and aspects of health and whether these relationships are heterogeneous across the 27 Brazilian states. According to data from the 2013 Brazilian National Health Survey, 18% of households participated in BF. Among households with household per capita income below BRL 500, many aspects of health differed between people living in BF and non-BF houses. For example, BF households were less likely to have medical coverage but more likely to have visited the doctor in the last 12 months as well as being more likely to smoke and less likely to do exercise. They ate nearly one less serving of fruits and vegetables a week but were less likely to substitute junk food for a meal. They reported worse self-rated health but did not differ importantly on reporting illnesses. Moderate amounts of heterogeneity in the difference in health characteristics were found for some variables. For instance, medical coverage had an I2 value of 40.7% and the difference in coverage between BF and non-BF households ranged from -0.09 to -0.03. Some illnesses differed qualitatively across states such as high cholesterol, asthma and arthritis. This paper is the first to outline the health profile of people living in households receiving payments from a cash transfer program. It is also the first to find geographic heterogeneity in the relationship between a cash transfer program and health variables. These results suggest the possibility that the effect of cash transfer programs may differ based on the population on which it is implemented.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Brazil	31291427	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291427	asthma	1333053624108726661

Monoclonal antibody (McAb) has been established as one of the most successful therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer. M1A2 (McAb) as a new monoclonal antibody was designed to recognize heat shock protein (HSP60), but its optimum production condition has not been studied. In this study, the cell culture conditions for both Roswell Park Memorial Institute Medium (RPMI 1640) and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) were optimized using artificial neural network (ANN) analysis to obtain maximum production of IgM McAb by hybridoma M1A2 cells. By using a central composite design, an experimental matrix with cultivation parameters of incubation time, temperature and fetal bovine serum (FBS) concentration on IgM McAb production was designed. The results was analysed by ANN network with different learning algorithms. From the analysis, batch back propagation (BBP) trained ANN composed of eight hidden nodes using a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function was capable to provide the highest McAb production for both RPMI and DMEM media. Under optimum conditions of 12.5% of FBS, at 33 °C after 3(1/2) days of incubation, maximum McAb production (1132.69 μg/ml) in DMEM was achieved. With PRMI 1640 medium, maximum McAb production (1105.12 μg/ml) was achieved at optimum conditions of 11% of FBS, at 33 °C after 4 days of incubation. The results of this study will provide information for optimum culture conditions of M1A2 McAb production in both DMEM and RPMI 1640 media and also give some clues for the other hybridoma excreting antibodies in the development of in vitro cell culture.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31312930	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312930	cancer	1106203543388094548

The VH1-2 restricted VRC01-class of antibodies targeting the HIV envelope CD4 binding site are a major focus of HIV vaccine strategies. However, a detailed analysis of VRC01-class antibody development has been limited by the rare nature of these responses during natural infection and the lack of longitudinal sampling of such responses. To inform vaccine strategies, we mapped the development of a VRC01-class antibody lineage (PCIN63) in the subtype C infected IAVI Protocol C neutralizer PC063. PCIN63 monoclonal antibodies had the hallmark VRC01-class features and demonstrated neutralization breadth similar to the prototype VRC01 antibody, but were 2- to 3-fold less mutated. Maturation occurred rapidly within ∼24 months of emergence of the lineage and somatic hypermutations accumulated at key contact residues. This longitudinal study of broadly neutralizing VRC01-class antibody lineage reveals early binding to the N276-glycan during affinity maturation, which may have implications for vaccine design.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31315032	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315032	HIV	3533132794957138580

2208	2208	22	Journal of the American Heart Association	Deletion of the Cardiomyocyte Glucocorticoid Receptor Leads to Sexually Dimorphic Changes in Cardiac Gene Expression and Progression to Heart Failure.	Background The contribution of glucocorticoids to sexual dimorphism in the heart is essentially unknown. Therefore, we sought to determine the sexually dimorphic actions of glucocorticoid signaling in cardiac function and gene expression. To accomplish this goal, we conducted studies on mice lacking glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in cardiomyocytes (cardioGRKO mouse model). Methods and Results Deletion of cardiomyocyte GR leads to an increase in mortality because of the development of spontaneous cardiac pathology in both male and female mice; however, females are more resistant to GR signaling inactivation in the heart. Male cardioGRKO mice had a median survival age of 6 months. In contrast, females had a median survival age of 10 months. Transthoracic echocardiography data showed phenotypic differences between male and female cardioGRKO hearts. By 3 months of age, male cardioGRKO mice exhibited left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Conversely, no significant functional deficits were observed in female cardioGRKO mice at the same time point. Functional sensitivity of male hearts to the loss of cardiomyocyte GR was reversed following gonadectomy. RNA-Seq analysis showed that deleting GR in the male hearts leads to a more profound dysregulation in the expression of genes implicated in heart rate regulation (calcium handling). In agreement with these gene expression data, cardiomyocytes isolated from male cardioGRKO hearts displayed altered intracellular calcium responses. In contrast, female GR-deficient cardiomyocytes presented a response comparable with controls. Conclusions These data suggest that GR regulates calcium responses in a sex-biased manner, leading to sexually distinct responses to stress in male and female mice hearts, which may contribute to sex differences in heart disease, including the development of ventricular arrhythmias that contribute to heart failure and sudden death.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31311395	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311395	heart+disease	-326357109758599578

DOCK8 deficiency is a rare inherited combined immunodeficiency, caused by mutations in the DOCK8 gene. We describe a case with DOCK8 deficiency associated with severe CLD in whom orthotopic LT was performed successfully after allogeneic HSCT. A 5 year-old girl with DOCK8 deficiency presented with mild direct hyperbilirubinemia and abnormal GGT level and without a previous history of jaundice. She had severe growth retardation, hepatosplenomegaly and generalized eczema. Progressive worsening of CLD was observed within 4 months. Investigations for etiology of liver disease were negative. Liver biopsy showed bridging necrosis, cholestasis and, cirrhosis. Recurrent immune hemolytic crisis and several viral infections developed in follow-up. She underwent whole cadaveric LT for end-stage liver disease (ESLD) 1 year after allogenic HSCT from a full matched related donor. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient is alive with normal liver function and moderate skin graft versus host disease for 36 months after LT. In conclusion DOCK8 deficiency can be associated with severe CLD. Successful LT following HSCT is possible in patients with ESLD in DOCK8 deficiency. The timing of LT is challenging in patients requiring both HSCT and LT since conditioning regimens for HSCT can be highly hepatotoxic and the patients with suboptimal liver function can become decompensated during HSCT.	2019	eng	Case Reports	Denmark	31297914	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297914	Cirrhosis	-6902744509271060072

"Women with a history of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) are at increased risk of future diabetes and related Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) as are their offspring. ""Transgenerational transmission occurs"". Independent of genetic risk, offspring of hyperglycaemic pregnancies are at increased risk of early onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (Type 2 DM) and obesity. Differences exist in offspring risk of diabetes and obesity based on time and type of diabetes exposure in utero. There is a risk gradient, wherein type 2 DM exposure confers greater risk and reduces time to development of type 2 DM in the offspring compared with exposure to GDM and no diabetes exposure. These data suggest, glucose dose dependence in risk transmission. Given that the age of onset of prediabetes and type 2 DM is declining many reproductive age women may have undiagnosed diabetes or dysglycaemia when they become pregnant. This has great public health significance and it has become imperative that all pregnant women should be screened for hyperglycemia even if they have no symptoms. Ministry of Health, Government of India has developed the national guidelines for testing, diagnosis and management of hyperglycemia in pregnancy. These guidelines recommend early testing at booking, to be repeated again between 24-28 weeks if negative at first testing. The guideline also recommends that GDM can be diagnosed if the 2 hr PG is ≥140mg/dl after 75 gm of oral glucose administration without regard to the time of the last meal (i.e., fasting or non-fasting). This approach has also been endorsed by International Diabetes Federation (IDF), World Health Organization (WHO) and International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) for resource constrained settings.The aim should be to target new born baby's birth weight, appropriate for gestational age (2.5 to 3.5 kg) to prevent the offspring developing NCD in the future. For this to happen early diagnosis and tight maternal glucose control during pregnancy similar to glycaemic level in the normal pregnancy, (FPG between 80 and 90 mg, 2 hr. post prandial between 110 and 120 mg) is necessary."	2019	eng	Journal Article	India	31309801	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309801	obesity	-8083832514395551465

2217	2217	96	Biomaterials science	A chloroplast-inspired nanoplatform for targeting cancer and synergistic photodynamic/photothermal therapy.	Specific targeting capabilities and effective phototherapeutic functions are the key demands for precise cancer phototherapeutic agents. Herein, a bioinspired nanoplatform composed of Cu(ii)-chlorophyll-hyaluronic acid nanoparticles (Cu(ii)Chl-HA NPs) was developed for targeting cancer and synergistic photodynamic/photothermal therapy. Inspired by the photonic biosystem of the chloroplast, Cu(ii) chlorophyll was used as a photosensitive substituent to covalently connect with a hydrophilic HA tail rather than a natural phytol tail, and this conjugate further assembled into a nanoparticle-like morphology under non-covalent interaction. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu(ii) chlorophyll has a much smaller energy gap between an excited singlet and excited triplet, and theoretically leads to rapid electron intersystem crossing that would benefit the PDT effect. In addition, a series of experiments have proven that, under 650 nm laser irradiation, the nanoplatform of Cu(ii)Chl-HA can produce a high amount of singlet oxygen and exhibit an outstanding photothermal conversion capability. More interestingly, owing to the specific interactions between the HA component and the CD44 receptor on the cell membrane, the HA tails impart Cu(ii)Chl-HA NPs an excellent receptor-mediated targeting performance toward CD44-overexpressing cancer cells. Based on these features, the nanoplatform of Cu(ii)Chl-HA NPs presents active targeting and outstanding dual modality synergistic PDT/PTT performance of cancer both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this work opens up a new strategy to fabricate a bioinspired multifunctional cancer phototherapy nanoplatform.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31313766	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313766	cancer	-5446204508747882127

Peptide YY3-36 (PYY3-36) is an endogenous ligand of the neuropeptide Y2 receptor (Y2R), on which it acts to reduce food intake. Chemically modified PYY3-36 analogs with extended half-lives are potential therapeutics for the treatment of obesity. Here we show that the common half-life extending strategies PEGylation and lipidation not only control PYY3-36's pharmacokinetics but also affects central aspects of its pharmacodynamics. PEGylation of PYY3-36 inhibited endocytosis by increasing receptor dissociation rates (koff), which reduced arrestin-3 (Arr3) activity. This is the first link between Arr3 recruitment and Y2R residence time. C16-lipidation of PYY3-36 had negligible impact on Y2R signaling, binding, and endocytosis. In contrast, C18acid-lipidation minimized endocytosis, which indicated a decreased internalization through non-arrestin-related mechanisms. We propose a temporal model that connects properties and position of the half-life extender with receptor Gi versus Arr3 signaling bias. We believe that this will be important for future design of peptide therapeutics.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31310716	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310716	obesity	-2090760089450762391

The effect of combined electron-beam irradiation and aging temperature of pork on microbiological and physicochemical properties was investigated. The samples from pork shoulder were irradiated with 0 or 2 kGy, vacuum-packaged, and assigned randomly to an aging temperature (2°C, 10°C, or 25°C) during 8 d. On 4 d of aging at 25°C, total aerobic bacteria of non-irradiated ones reached 7 Log CFU/g which is no salable levels. Shear force values of irradiated meat after aging for 2 and 4 d at 25°C was lower than those aged at 2°C. Irradiated samples at 2°C had lower cooking loss after 2 and 8 d of aging, compared with other aging temperatures. Irradiation did not accelerate 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) value when aged up to 4 d. Irradiated samples aged at 10°C and 25°C for 8 d scored significantly higher TBARS values. With an increased aging period, a* and b* in irradiated samples at 2°C slightly increased, but irradiation caused negligible changes in meat color. The highest contents of a desirable nucleotide flavor compounds (inosine-5-phosphate) were observed in pork at 2°C when aged for 4 and 8 d, while the lowest contents were observed at 25°C. Aging in irradiated pork for 8 d at 2°C resulted in optimal condition with improved meat quality and minimal microbiologically negative defect.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Korea (South)	31304478	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304478	aging	-55755961199248325

2222	2222	61	Journal of cellular biochemistry	The protective effect of cycloastragenol on aging mouse circadian rhythmic disorder induced by d-galactose.	Aging process in mammals is associated with a decline in amplitude and a long period of circadian behaviors which are regulated by a central circadian regulator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and local oscillators in peripheral tissues. It is unclear whether enhancing clock function can retard aging. Using fibroblasts expressing per2::lucSV and senescent cells, we revealed cycloastragenol (CAG), a natural aglycone derivative from astragaloside IV, as a clock amplitude enhancing small molecule. CAG could activate telomerase to antiaging, but no reports focused on its effects on circadian rhythm disorders in aging mice. Here we analyze the potential effects of CAG on d-galactose-induced aging mice on the circadian behavior and expression of clock genes. For this purpose, CAG (20 mg/kg orally), was administered daily to d-galactose (150 mg/kg, subcutaneous) mice model of aging for 6 weeks. An actogram analysis of free-running activity of these mice showed that CAG significantly enhances the locomotor activity. We further found that CAG increase expressions of per2 and bmal1 genes in liver and kidney of aging mouse. Furthermore, CAG enhanced clock protein BMAL1 and PER2 levels in aging mouse liver and SCN. Our results indicated that the CAG could restore the behavior of circadian rhythm in aging mice induced by d-galactose. These data of present study suggested that CAG could be used as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of age-related circadian rhythm disruption.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31310357	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310357	aging	-7448252416950961815

Molecular basis of disease	Phosphoproteomics of Alzheimer disease brain: Insights into altered brain protein regulation of critical neuronal functions and their contributions to subsequent cognitive loss.	Alzheimer disease (AD) is the major locus of dementia worldwide. In the USA there are nearly 6 million persons with this disorder, and estimates of 13-20 million AD cases in the next three decades. The molecular bases for AD remain unknown, though processes involving amyloid beta-peptide as small oligomeric forms are gaining attention as known agents to both lead to oxidative stress and synaptic dysfunction associated with cognitive dysfunction in AD and its earlier forms, including amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and possibly preclinical Alzheimer disease (PCAD). Altered brain protein phosphorylation is a hallmark of AD, and phosphoproteomics offers an opportunity to identify these altered phosphoproteins in order to gain more insights into molecular mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction and death that lead to cognitive loss. This paper reviews what, to this author, are believed to be the known phosphoproteomics studies related to in vitro and in vivo models of AD as well as phosphoproteomics studies of brains from subjects with AD, and in at least one case in MCI and PCAD as well. The results of this review are discussed with relevance to new insights into AD brain protein dysregulation in critical neuronal functions and to potential therapeutic targets to slow, or in favorable cases, halt progression of this dementing disorder that affects millions of persons and their families worldwide.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31167728	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31167728	Alzheimer	7906867252266782644

2227	2227	507	Heart (British Cardiac Society)	Cardiomyopathy and pregnancy.	Cardiomyopathy is a group of disorders in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal in the absence of other diseases that could cause observed myocardial abnormality. The most common cardiomyopathies are hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. Rare types are arrhythmogenic right ventricular, restrictive, Takotsubo and left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathies. This review of cardiomyopathies in pregnancy shows that peripartum cardiomyopathy is the most common cardiomyopathy in pregnancy. Peripartum cardiomyopathy develops most frequently in the month before or after partum, whereas dilated cardiomyopathy often is known already or develops in the second trimester. Mortality in peripartum cardiomyopathy varies from <2% to 50%. Few reports on dilated cardiomyopathy and pregnancy exist, with only a limited number of patients. Ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure, stroke and death are found in 39%-60% of high-risk patients. However, patients with modest left ventricular dysfunction and good functional class tolerated pregnancy well. Previous studies on >700 pregnancies in 500 women with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy showed that prognosis was generally good, even though three deaths were reported in high-risk patients. Complications include different types of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure and ischaemic stroke. Recent studies on 200 pregnancies in 100 women with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy have reported symptoms, including heart failure in 18%-33% of pregnancies. Ventricular tachycardia was found in 0%-33% of patients and syncope in one patient. Information on rare cardiomyopathies is sparse and only presented in case reports. Close monitoring by multidisciplinary teams in referral centres that counsel patients before conception and follow them throughout gestation is recommended.	2019	eng	Review	England	31308064	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308064	stroke	6001127456099879458

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a multispectral disorder requiring lifelong management. Its pathophysiology is still being explored which makes its treatment options restrained. Present study explores impact of oral contraceptive mode of treatment on metabolic, hormonal, inflammation and coagulation profile of PCOS women. 50 subjects diagnosed with Rotterdam criteria receiving no drug treatment served as controls whereas 50 subjects receiving only OCPs (Ethinyl estradiol 0.03 mg, Levonorgestrel 0.15 mg) as a mode of treatment at least for six-months served as cases. Ferriman-Gallwey score and hormonal profile improved on OCP treatment. However, parameters like weight, Body mass index, waist-hip ratio, Oral glucose tolerance test, lipid profile, insulin, HOMA-IR, adiponectin, interleukin1β, visfatin, resistin, tissue factor, PT and APTT showed considerable derangements in OCP group. All above parameters are associated with the risk of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, coronary vascular disease, cancers, hypercoagulable state, venous thromboembolism and thrombotic events. Long-term use of OCPs needs to be considered carefully for PCOS patients who are already burdened with associated risk factors. This study was conducted in a region where women do not have much access to high-end screening and diagnostic facilities that further exacerbates their clinical outcomes. Large scale, long-term studies need to be designed to further evaluate safety use of OCPs in PCOS women.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31308416	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308416	diabetes	3273084325487543386
2229	2229	22	Immunity	Inflammation and Cancer: Triggers, Mechanisms, and Consequences.	Inflammation predisposes to the development of cancer and promotes all stages of tumorigenesis. Cancer cells, as well as surrounding stromal and inflammatory cells, engage in well-orchestrated reciprocal interactions to form an inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME). Cells within the TME are highly plastic, continuously changing their phenotypic and functional characteristics. Here, we review the origins of inflammation in tumors, and the mechanisms whereby inflammation drives tumor initiation, growth, progression, and metastasis. We discuss how tumor-promoting inflammation closely resembles inflammatory processes typically found during development, immunity, maintenance of tissue homeostasis, or tissue repair and illuminate the distinctions between tissue-protective and pro-tumorigenic inflammation, including spatiotemporal considerations. Defining the cornerstone rules of engagement governing molecular and cellular mechanisms of tumor-promoting inflammation will be essential for further development of anti-cancer therapies.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31315034	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315034	cancer	-4126288159365354498
2230	2230	453	Journal of hepatology	News in Pathophysiology, Definition and Classification of Hepatorenal Syndrome: a step beyond the International Club of Ascites (ICA) Consensus document.	"Renal dysfunction is a common, life-threatening complication occurring in patients with liver disease. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) has been defined as a purely ""functional"" type of renal failure that often occurs in patients with cirrhosis in the setting of marked abnormalities in arterial circulation, as well as overactivity of the endogenous vasoactive systems (4-5). HRS has been classified by the ICA in 2007 into two types, HRS-1 and HRS-2 (5). HRS-1 is characterized by a rapid deterioration of renal function that often occurs because of a precipitating event, while HRS-2 is a moderate and stable or slowly progressive renal dysfunction that often occurs without an obvious precipitant. Clinically, HRS-1 is characterized by acute renal failure while HRS-2 is mainly characterized by refractory ascites. Nevertheless, after these two entities were first described, new concepts, definitions, and diagnostic criteria have been developed by nephrologists for renal dysfunction in the general population and hospitalized patients. In particular, the definitions and characterization of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), Acute Kidney Disease (AKD) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) have been introduced/refined (6). Accordingly, a debate among hepatologists of the International Club of Ascites (ICA), led to a complete revision of the nomenclature and diagnosis of HRS-1, renaming it as HRS-AKI (7). Additionally, over recent years, greater granularity has also been gained regarding the pathogenesis of HRS and it is now increasingly recognized that it is not a purely ""functional"" entity with hemodynamic derangements but that systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and bile salt-related tubular damage may contribute significantly to its development. That is, HRS has an additional structural component that would not only make traditional diagnostic criteria less reliable but would explain the lack of response to pharmacological treatment with vasoconstrictors plus albumin that correlates with a progressive increase in inflammation. Because classification, nomenclature, diagnostic criteria and pathogenic theories have evolved over the years since the traditional classification of HRS-1 and HRS-2 was first described, it was considered that all these novel aspects be reviewed and summarized in a position paper. The aim of this position paper authored by two hepatologists (members of ICA) and two nephrologists involved in the study of renal dysfunction in cirrhosis, is to complete the re-classification of HRS initiated by the ICA in 2012 and to update the knowledge on the definition, classification, diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment of HRS."	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31302175	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302175	Cirrhosis	6247175512001835023

Interarm blood pressure difference (IAD) is a risk factor for peripheral artery disease and cardio-cerebral vascular disease (CCVD). The current study examines the association of IAD with stroke and coronary heart disease in a Chinese community. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Pudong New Area in Shanghai, China. A total of 10 657 residents aged 15 years and older were randomly selected through three-stage sampling. Volunteers had systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) measured in both arms at recruitment, and IAD was defined in both arms as the absolute difference in BP. Medical records of study participants were reviewed by investigators to confirm measurements. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between systolic interarm blood pressure difference (sIAD) and diastolic interarm blood pressure difference (dIAD) with stroke and coronary heart disease. Compared with dIAD <5 mm Hg, the multivariate adjusted odds ratio (OR) of stroke prevalence was 1.357 (95% CI 0.725-2.542, P = 0.034) for dIAD ≥20 mm Hg and 1.702 (95% CI1.025-2.828, P = 0.040) for dIAD between 15 and 19 mm Hg, and the multivariate adjusted OR of coronary heart disease prevalence was 1.726 (95% CI 1.093-2.726, P = 0.019) for dIAD ≥20 mm Hg and 1.498 (95% CI 0.993-2.261, P = 0.044) for dIAD between 15 and 19 mm Hg. The relationship between cardio-cerebral vascular disease and dIAD was significant in a Chinese community population. Further cohort studies are needed to investigate the association of different levels of IAD with the incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and subsequent mortality.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31304684	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304684	heart+disease	-635870441391555852
2232	2232	756	Autophagy	Autophagy: a potential key contributor to the therapeutic action of mesenchymal stem cells.	Macroautophagy/autophagy occurs at basal levels in all eukaryotic cells and plays an important role in maintaining bio-energetic homeostasis through the control of molecule degradation and organelle turnover. It can be induced by environmental conditions such as starvation, and is deregulated in many diseases including autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. Interestingly, the modulation of autophagy in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represents a possible mechanism which, affecting MSC properties, may have an impact on their regenerative, therapeutic potential. Furthermore, the ability of MSCs to modulate autophagy of cells in injured tissues/organs has been recently proposed to be involved in the regeneration of damaged tissues and organs. In particular, MSCs can affect autophagy in immune cells involved in injury-induced inflammation reducing their survival, proliferation, and function and favoring the resolution of inflammation. In addition, MSCs can affect autophagy in endogenous adult or progenitor cells, promoting their survival, proliferation and differentiation supporting the restoration of functional tissue. This review provides, for the first time, an overview of the studies which highlight a possible link between the therapeutic properties of MSCs and their ability to modulate autophagy, and it summarizes examples of disorders where these therapeutic properties have been correlated with such modulation. A better elucidation of the mechanism(s) through which MSCs can modulate the autophagy of target cells and how autophagy can affect MSCs therapeutic properties, can provide a wider perspective for the clinical application of MSCs in the treatment of many diseases. 	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31185790	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31185790	Alzheimer	-6526049170878205106

Until very recently, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was a disease diagnosed in adults, but as the childhood obesity epidemic has spread, the diagnosis of T2DM in adolescents has become more common. Early indicators suggest that the disease may be more severe and more difficult to manage when diagnosed in adolescents. It is projected that adolescents with T2DM will lose approximately 15 years of life. The economic burden of T2DM rises significantly as the years with disease increase. This grim forecast highlights that not only will the disease burden be significant but the economic burden will be high. The risk for developing T2DM begins in utero. Individual health development trajectories build from this starting point, the result of multiple factors that accumulate across time and are the result of biological conditioning during sensitive developmental periods. A major aim of this chapter is to demonstrate that a life course health development approach to pediatric T2DM is critical to a sound national strategy to prevent and treat pediatric T2DM. We review major factors known to influence the development of pediatric T2DM and track these across childhood. While these factors will likely change over the next decade, what will not change is the importance of placing these factors into context and recognizing that T2DM development is highly sensitive to the timing and social structures of multiple environmental exposures. Research recommendations are discussed through a life course lens.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314290	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314290	diabetes	-6644783190271298310

HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remain prevalent and are aggravated by µ-opioid use. We have previously shown that morphine and other µ-opioids may contribute to HAND by inhibiting the homeostatic and neuroprotective chemokine receptor CXCR4 in cortical neurons, and this novel mechanism depends on upregulation of the protein ferritin heavy chain (FHC). Here, we examined the cellular events and potential mechanisms involved in morphine-mediated FHC upregulation using rat cortical neurons of either sex in vitro and in vivo. Morphine dose-dependently increased FHC protein levels in primary neurons through µ-opioid receptor (µOR) and Gαi-protein signaling. Cytoplasmic FHC levels were significantly elevated, but nuclear FHC levels and FHC gene expression were unchanged. Morphine-treated rats also displayed increased FHC levels in layer 2/3 neurons of the prefrontal cortex. Importantly, both in vitro and in vivo FHC upregulation was accompanied by loss of mature dendritic spines, which was also dependent on µOR and Gαi-protein signaling. Moreover, morphine upregulated ferritin light chain (FLC), a component of the ferritin iron storage complex, suggesting that morphine altered neuronal iron metabolism. Indeed, prior to FHC upregulation, morphine increased cytoplasmic labile iron levels as a function of decreased endolysosomal iron. In line with this, chelation of endolysosomal iron (but not extracellular iron) blocked morphine-induced FHC upregulation and dendritic spine reduction, whereas iron overloading mimicked the effect of morphine on FHC and dendritic spines. Overall, these data demonstrate that iron mediates morphine-induced FHC upregulation and consequent dendritic spine deficits and implicate endolysosomal iron efflux to the cytoplasm in these effects.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31300544	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300544	HIV	-9050450867630628092

We present a case of a 32-year-old woman with signs and symptoms of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), but who, upon further investigation, was found to have human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum. This rare cause of meningitis in an immunocompetent individual and a relatively unique presentation is described along with a review of proper diagnostic workup and treatment. HHV-6 meningitis is commonly detected via molecular diagnostics and thus needs confirmatory testing of viral load of acellular compartments or viral serology. The reason for this added diagnostic step is due to the incorporation of the virus into the host DNA, leading to increased false-positive results on screening tests. In this case, proper diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up were pursued by following guidelines proposed in the literature of HHV-6 meningitis.	2019	eng	Case Reports	United States	31312562	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312562	headache	7883212773611521498

2248	2248	208	 	 	This open access handbook synthesizes and analyzes the growing knowledge base on life course health development (LCHD) from the prenatal period through emerging adulthood, with implications for clinical practice and public health. It presents LCHD as an innovative field with a sound theoretical framework for understanding wellness and disease from a lifespan perspective, replacing previous medical, biopsychosocial, and early genomic models of health. Interdisciplinary chapters discuss major health concerns (diabetes, obesity), important less-studied conditions (hearing, kidney health), and large-scale issues (nutrition, adversity) from a lifespan viewpoint. In addition, chapters address methodological approaches and challenges by analyzing existing measures, studies, and surveys. The book concludes with the editors’ research agenda that proposes priorities for future LCHD research and its application to health care practice and health policy. Topics featured in the Handbook include: The prenatal period and its effect on child obesity and metabolic outcomes. Pregnancy complications and their effect on women’s cardiovascular health. A multi-level approach for obesity prevention in children. Application of the LCHD framework to autism spectrum disorder. Socioeconomic disadvantage and its influence on health development across the lifespan. The importance of nutrition to optimal health development across the lifespan. The Handbook of Life Course Health Development is a must-have resource for researchers, clinicians/professionals, and graduate students in developmental psychology/science; maternal and child health; social work; health economics; educational policy and politics; and medical law as well as many interrelated subdisciplines in psychology, medicine, public health, mental health, education, social welfare, economics, sociology, and law.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314220	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314220	diabetes	1432311799980176241

Alzheimer disease (AD) is one of several neurodegenerative diseases characterized by dysregulation, misfolding and accumulation of specific proteins in the CNS. The stable isotope labelling kinetics (SILK) technique is based on generating amino acids labelled with naturally occurring stable (that is, nonradioactive) isotopes of carbon and/or nitrogen. These labelled amino acids can then be incorporated into proteins, enabling rates of protein production and clearance to be determined in vivo and in vitro without the use of radioactive or chemical labels. Over the past decade, SILK studies have been used to determine the turnover of key pathogenic proteins amyloid-β (Aβ), tau and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) in the cerebrospinal fluid of healthy individuals, patients with AD and those with other neurodegenerative diseases. These studies led to the identification of several factors that alter the production and/or clearance of these proteins, including age, sleep and disease-causing genetic mutations. SILK studies have also been used to measure Aβ turnover in blood and within brain tissue. SILK studies offer the potential to elucidate the mechanisms underlying various neurodegenerative disease mechanisms, including neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction, and to demonstrate target engagement of novel disease-modifying therapies.	2019	eng	Review	England	31222062	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31222062	Alzheimer	-7953698795259311774

The inhalation of Chenopodium album (C. album) pollen, especially polcalcin (Che a 3), has been reported as a significant source of allergic respiratory symptoms. This study was conducted to characterize biophysical differences of recombinant polcalcin come from three different Escherichia coli strains using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), optimize recombinant polcalcin expression, and linear B-cell epitopes identification using in silico methods. ATR-FTIR results of purified proteins showed spectra intensity variance in the amide I region, while there were no changes in pick position and shape of the bands. SHuffle® T7 Express was selected for subsequent optimization due to ability in the correction of the mis-oxidized bonds and promotes proper folding which was validated by ATR-FTIR analysis results. Then, Response Surface Methodology was performed to optimize critical factors including induction temperature, duration of induction, and concentration of inducer. The best partitioning conditions were achieved in 1.5 mM IPTG for 10.97 h at 29.9 °C. Finally, prediction of polcalcin B-cell epitopes was carried out which indicated the presence of 4 different epitopes. Together, the results may help to the development of diagnostic approaches and also vaccine manufacture for desensitization and modulation of the allergic response in patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31302128	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302128	vaccine	-5676280017759875198

And within that state, the 38 counties comprising South Texas--a highly populated, largely Hispanic area characterized by high uninsured rates and low numbers of health care providers--are emblematic of nationwide crises in public health. The South Texas Health Status Review: A Health Disparities Roadmap brings health care disparities to light in instructive detail. Over thirty key health conditions and risk factors, such as breast cancer, diabetes, obesity, tuberculosis, smoking and alcohol use, lead exposure, birth defects, and homicide rates, are analyzed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and location (urban or rural), and the results compared with the rest of Texas and the nation as a whole. A section on conclusions and recommendations outlines factors contributing to these conditions and offers suggestions for improvement. These important data should stimulate further population studies and provide impetus for targeted public health interventions and community outreach programs to reduce health inequities and advance care access in the state and the U.S. at large. Major health issues covered in the report include: • Communicable diseases • Cancer incidence and mortality • Maternal and child health • Chronic diseases • Behavioral risk factors in adults • Environmental health issues • Suicide, homicide, and vehicular mortality. The South Texas Health Status Review contains valuable lessons for researchers in health promotion and health disparities, as well as community health professionals. Policymakers involved in reducing health disparities will find it especially useful.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314218	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314218	tuberculosis	-3716447017462787559

Bayesian networks are used to evaluate the effectiveness of mixed autogenous vaccines in fattening lambs to prevent the ovine respiratory syndrome. An experiment was performed with 460 fattening lambs, which were clustered into four groups according to the kind of vaccine received (Pasteurella spp., Mycoplasma spp., Mixed Mycoplasma-Pasteurella or placebo). After slaughtering, lungs were collected, and macroscopic and microscopic studies were performed. A microbiological study was carried out to evaluate the presence of Mycoplasma spp. and Pasteurellaceae by conventional culture and identification by nested polymerase chain reaction. To the best of the authors' knowledge, Bayesian networks have not been used to evaluate the effect of vaccines on the absence/presence of lung consolidation. Our results revealed that the use of mixed autogenous vaccines can decrease lung consolidation from 15.75% (12.42-19.08) to 9.24% (6.59-11.89). Therefore, the use of these autogenous vaccines in farms could be considered an effective control tool against ovine respiratory syndrome.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31311630	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311630	vaccine	-7193893108516217330

Cardiovascular risk associated with fetal growth restriction (FGR) could result from an early impaired vascular function. However, whether this effect results in premature vascular aging has not been addressed. We studied the ex vivo reactivity of carotid and femoral arteries in fetal (near term), adults (eight months-old) and aged (16 months-old) guinea pigs in normal (control) and FGR offspring. Additionally, an epigenetic marker of vascular aging (i.e., LINE-1 DNA methylation) was evaluated in human umbilical artery endothelial cells (HUAEC) from control and FGR subjects. Control guinea pig arteries showed an increased contractile response (KCl-induced) and a progressive impairment of NO-mediated relaxing responses as animals get older. FGR was associated with an initial preserved carotid artery reactivity as well as a later significant impairment in NO-mediated responses. Femoral arteries from FGR fetuses showed an increased contractility but a decreased relaxing response compared with control fetuses, and both responses were impaired in FGR-adults. Finally, FGR-HUAEC showed decreased LINE-1 DNA methylation compared with control-HUAEC. These data suggest that the aging of vascular function occurs by changes in NO-mediated responses, with limited alterations in contractile capacity. Further, these effects are accelerated and imposed at early stages of development in subjects exposed to a suboptimal intrauterine environment.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31311132	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311132	aging	39554158227241538

Stroke often leads to neuronal injury and neurological functional deficits. Whilst spontaneous neurogenesis and axon regeneration are induced by ischemic stroke, effective pharmacological treatments are also essential for the improvement of neuroplasticity and functional recovery after stroke. However, no pharmacological therapy has been demonstrated to be able to effectively improve the functional recovery after stroke. Bumetanide is a specific Na +-K +-Cl- co-transporter inhibitor which can maintain chloride homeostasis in neurons. Therefore, many studies have focused on this drug's effect in stroke recovery in recent years. Here, we first review the function of Na +-K +-Cl- co-transporter in neurons, then how bumetanide's role in reducing brain damage, promoting neuroplasticity, leading to functional recovery after stroke, is elucidated. Finally, we discuss current limitations of bumetanide's efficiency and their potential solutions. These results may provide new avenues for further exploring mechanisms of post-stroke functional recovery as well as promising therapeutic targets for functional disability rehabilitation after ischemic stroke.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31306143	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306143	stroke	-7895534832212398576

2267	2267	309	Scientific reports	BK channel clustering is required for normal behavioral alcohol sensitivity in C. elegans.	The large conductance, calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channel, known as the BK channel, is one of the central proteins that mediate alcohol intoxication and tolerance across species. Although ethanol targets BK channels through direct interaction, how ethanol-mediated BK channel activation causes behavioral intoxication is poorly understood. In. C. elegans, loss of function in SLO-1, the BK channel ortholog, confers profound ethanol resistance in movement and egg-laying behaviors. Here, we show that depletion of SLO-1 channels clustered at the active zones with no change in the overall channel expression level results in locomotory resistance to the intoxicating effect of ethanol, equivalent to that of slo-1 loss-of-function mutants. Likewise, depletion of clustered SLO-1 channels in the sarcolemma and neurons leads to ethanol-resistant egg-laying behavior. By contrast, reduction in the overall SLO-1 channel level by over 70% causes only moderate ethanol resistance in movement, and minimal, if any, resistance in egg laying. Our findings strongly suggest that behavioral ethanol sensitivity is conferred by local, but not global, depression of excitability via clustered BK channels. Given that clustered BK channels are functionally coupled to, and localize near, calcium channels, ethanol may mediate its behavioral effects by targeting BK channels and their coupled calcium channels.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31308408	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308408	depression	5410603488837817052

Background The contribution of glucocorticoids to sexual dimorphism in the heart is essentially unknown. Therefore, we sought to determine the sexually dimorphic actions of glucocorticoid signaling in cardiac function and gene expression. To accomplish this goal, we conducted studies on mice lacking glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in cardiomyocytes (cardioGRKO mouse model). Methods and Results Deletion of cardiomyocyte GR leads to an increase in mortality because of the development of spontaneous cardiac pathology in both male and female mice; however, females are more resistant to GR signaling inactivation in the heart. Male cardioGRKO mice had a median survival age of 6 months. In contrast, females had a median survival age of 10 months. Transthoracic echocardiography data showed phenotypic differences between male and female cardioGRKO hearts. By 3 months of age, male cardioGRKO mice exhibited left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Conversely, no significant functional deficits were observed in female cardioGRKO mice at the same time point. Functional sensitivity of male hearts to the loss of cardiomyocyte GR was reversed following gonadectomy. RNA-Seq analysis showed that deleting GR in the male hearts leads to a more profound dysregulation in the expression of genes implicated in heart rate regulation (calcium handling). In agreement with these gene expression data, cardiomyocytes isolated from male cardioGRKO hearts displayed altered intracellular calcium responses. In contrast, female GR-deficient cardiomyocytes presented a response comparable with controls. Conclusions These data suggest that GR regulates calcium responses in a sex-biased manner, leading to sexually distinct responses to stress in male and female mice hearts, which may contribute to sex differences in heart disease, including the development of ventricular arrhythmias that contribute to heart failure and sudden death.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31311395	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311395	stress	-8964534883296838326
2273	2273	13	European journal of endocrinology	MANAGEMENT OF ENDOCRINE DISEASE: Immune check point inhibitors-induced hypophysitis.	In recent years, the development of immunotherapy has constituted a revolution in the therapy for many cancers, with a specific toxicity profile including endocrine immune-related adverse events. Immune check point inhibitors (ICI)-induced hypophysitis is a common endocrine side effect, particularly with CTLA-4 antibodies and combination therapy, with frequent hormonal deficiencies at diagnosis. It can be difficult to evoke such diagnosis as the initial clinical symptoms are not specific (headache, asthenia…); thus, patients receiving such immunomodulatory therapies should be closely monitored by systematic hormone measurements, especially in the first weeks of treatment. Usually, hormonal deficiencies improve, except for corticotroph function. Despite a lack of large prospective studies on ICI-induced hypophysitis, some detailed longitudinal cohort studies have focused on such cases of hypophysitis and allow for optimal monitoring, follow-up and management of patients with this immune-related adverse event. In the case of ICI-induced hypophysitis, patients need long-term multidisciplinary follow-up, with specific education for those patients with corticotropin deficiency to allow them to be autonomous with their treatment. In this review, based on a clinical case, we detail the most relevant and novel aspects related to the incidence, diagnosis, treatment, evolution and management of hypophysitis induced by immunotherapy, with a focus on possible mechanisms and current recommendations and guidelines. Lastly, we emphasize several key points, such as the absence of indication to systematically treat with high-dose glucocorticoid and the pursuit of immunotherapy in such hypophysitis. These points should be kept in mind by oncologists and endocrinologists who treat and monitor patients treated by immunotherapy.	2019	eng	Review	England	31311002	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311002	headache	-7565625515044903967

The influenza virus is RNA virus and is classified into four subtypes, influenza A, influenza B, influenza C, and influenza D. One of the subtypes of influenza A, the H1N1 strain, also known as swine flu, is especially of high risk for development of complications in pregnant women. The influenza A virus infection is difficult to diagnose clinically because its presenting symptoms are similar to those of the common cold but are more severe, last longer, and can be potentially life-threatening. This case also presented with common cold symptoms but her condition worsened later. Fortunately, obstetric health providers were vigilant enough to address the developing infection and its related complications. It was the cooperative effort of multidisciplinary team care which resulted in a favourable outcome in both mother and baby.	2019	eng	Case Reports	United States	31139480	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31139480	flu	-3832772858396854546
2276	2276	23	Cells	Viroporins in the Influenza Virus.	Influenza is a highly contagious virus that causes seasonal epidemics and unpredictable pandemics. Four influenza virus types have been identified to date: A, B, C, and D, where only A-C are known to infect humans. Influenza A (IAV) and B (IBV) viruses are responsible for seasonal influenza epidemics in humans and are responsible for up to a billion flu infections annually. The M2 protein is present in all influenza types and belongs to the class of viroporins (i.e., small proteins that form ion channels that increase membrane permeability in virus-infected cells). In influenza A and B, AM2 and BM2 are predominantly proton channels, although they also show some permeability to monovalent cations. In contrast, M2 proteins in influenza C (ICV) and D (IDV), CM2 and DM2, appear to be especially selective for chloride ions, with possibly some permeability to protons. These differences point to different biological roles for M2 in types A and B versus C and D, which is also reflected in their sequences. AM2 is by far the best characterized viroporin, and mechanistic details and rationale of its acid activation, proton selectivity, unidirectionality and relative low conductance are just beginning to be understood. The present review summarizes the biochemical and structural aspects of influenza viroporins and discusses the most relevant aspects of function, inhibition and interaction with the host.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31261944	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31261944	flu	-1302167511807875596

2278	2278	124	Biologie aujourd'hui	[Migraine epidemiological, ﻿clinical and therapeutic data].	Burden of disease study ranks headache disorders as the second leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide. Migraine has an estimated prevalence of 10 to 14% and is therefore the most common neurological pathology. It concerns young populations, with a female/male ratio of 3/1, and its impact in economic terms is mainly related to indirect costs. Migraine can be episodic or chronic depending on the frequency of headache days (≥ 15 days per month). The diagnosis of migraine is made according to international criteria, which are easy to use, with essential questions to be asked to patients in a logical order and structure. The migraine is explained by an activation of the so-called trigeminocervical system, with release of neuromediators participating in neurogenic inflammation and activation of second-order neurons. Migraine with aura is manifested by neurological symptoms, lasting less than 60 minutes, explained by the phenomenon of cortical spreading depression. Visual symptoms are the most commonly described aura event of migraine, other auras include sensory and speech disturbance. Cortical spreading depression is a slowly propagating wave of near-complete depolarization of neurons and glial cells spreading over the cortex at a speed of ∼3-5 mm/min. First-line acute treatment for migraine consists of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), triptans and antiemetics. Patients with frequent or chronic headaches warrant prophylactic therapy. Various classes of preventives can be used (β-blockers, tricyclics, antiepileptics), with the choice of therapy tailored to the patient's risk factors and symptoms. In practice, treatment has two axes: NSAID or triptans for crisis treatment and for background treatment prescribed case by case, the first-intention molecules according to the French recommendations are beta-blockers, then, in case of failure, topiramate, oxetorone or amitriptyline.	2019	fre	Journal Article	France	31274101	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31274101	headache	-3302834510061927448

2282	2282	302	Vaccine	Acceptance and uptake of influenza vaccines in Asia: A systematic review.	In Asia, the public health burden of influenza is significant despite the existence of efficacious influenza vaccines. Annual seasonal influenza vaccination can reduce the incidence of influenza significantly, yet influenza vaccination coverage remains low in this part of the world. As a densely populated region with varying climatic zones and a larger proportion of developing countries compared to the West, Asia is at increased risk of influenza. To provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the Asian region, the key objective of this systematic review is to examine the determinants of vaccination uptake in Asia, beyond that of existing studies that have largely been western-centric. We carried out a systematic review of peer-reviewed scientific research, examining the key determinants, acceptance and uptake of influenza vaccinations across Asia. A comprehensive search strategy was defined to capture studies that met the inclusion criteria of articles published in English, from 2008 to 2018, focusing on adult populations within Asia. A total of 83 relevant studies were appraised in this review. Analyses of the extant data confirmed that vaccination rates within Asia are low, and that most countries lack scientific research on vaccination behaviours. Studies were categorised into four different population groups: healthcare workers, high risk groups, general population and uniform groups. The motivators and deterrents for vaccine uptake varied according to population groups and characteristics. Both general populations and healthcare workers were concerned with vaccine safety and efficacy, and recommendations from health authorities were influential in vaccine uptake within the other populations. The findings suggest that further research is needed within a broader range of Asian countries to garner greater in-depth knowledge of vaccination behaviours in the region. In particular, influenza vaccination programs within Asia should focus on improving engagement more effectively, through greater relatability and transparency of data when educating the public.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31301918	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301918	vaccine	8115033558441775155

Understanding maternal dengue virus (DENV) neutralizing antibody kinetics in infants remains timely to develop a safe and effective childhood immunization. This retrospective study evaluated the prevalence and persistence of maternal antibody titers against DENV serotypes 1 to 4 in 139 Thai infants at 2, 6, and 7 months of age, using serum samples collected in a vaccination trial ( http://clinicaltrials.gov ; NCT00197275). Neutralizing antibodies against all 4 DENV serotypes were detected in 87.8% and 22.9% of infants at 2 and 7 months, respectively. At 2 months, DENV-4 neutralizing antibody geometric mean titers were notably lower (80) compared with DENV-1 to DENV-3 (277-471). Our results corroborate previous findings that DENV-1 to DENV-4 maternal antibodies persist at 7 months despite titers decrease from 2 months onwards. As persisting maternal antibodies may inhibit immune responses in DENV-vaccinated infants, a comprehensive understanding of DENV antibody kinetics is required in the perspective of vaccine development for infants.	2019	eng	Journal Article	China	31307216	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307216	vaccine	-1119244241345534741
2284	2284	740	Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE	Identification of Orexin and Endocannabinoid Receptors in Adult Zebrafish Using Immunoperoxidase and Immunofluorescence Methods.	Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a highly sensitive and specific technique involved in the detection of target antigens in tissue sections with labeled antibodies. It is a multistep process in which the optimization of each step is crucial to obtain the optimum specific signal. Through IHC, the distribution and localization of specific biomarkers can be detected, revealing information on evolutionary conservation. Moreover, IHC allows for the understanding of expression and distribution changes of biomarkers in pathological conditions, such as obesity. IHC, mainly the immunofluorescence technique, can be used in adult zebrafish to detect the organization and distribution of phylogenetically conserved molecules, but a standard IHC protocol is not estasblished. Orexin and endocannabinoid are two highly conserved systems involved in the control of food intake and obesity pathology. Reported here are protocols used to obtain information about orexin peptide (OXA), orexin receptor (OX-2R), and cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) localization and distribution in the gut and brain of normal and diet-induced obese (DIO) adult zebrafish models. Also described are methods for immunoperoxidase and double immunofluorescence, as well as preparation of reagents, fixation, paraffin-embedding, and cryoprotection of zebrafish tissue and preparation for an endogenous activity-blocking step and background counterstaining. The complete set of parameters is obtained from previous IHC experiments, through which we have shown how immunofluorescence can help with the understanding of OXs, OX-2R, and CB1R distribution, localization, and conservation of expression in adult zebrafish tissues. The resulting images with highly specific signal intensity led to the confirmation that zebrafish are suitable animal models for immunohistochemical studies of distribution, localization, and evolutionary conservation of specific biomarkers in physiological and pathological conditions. The protocols presented here are recommended for IHC experiments in adult zebrafish.	2019	eng	Video-Audio Media	United States	31305518	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305518	obesity	-6308850935767965758

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide and is characterized in part by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The main pathological hallmark of PD is the intraneuronal accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates. Mutations in the SNCA gene (encoding α-syn) and variations in its copy number are associated with some forms of familial PD. In the present study, T-006, a new tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) derivative with recently reported anti-Alzheimer activity, is shown to significantly promote α-syn degradation in a cellular PD model. Moreover, we illustrate that T-006 inhibits the accumulation of both Triton-soluble and -insoluble forms of α-syn and protects against α-syn-induced neurotoxicity in A53T-α-syn transgenic mice. The mechanism of action of T-006 was verified by evaluation of a potential protein degradation pathway. We found that T-006 promotes α-syn degradation in a proteasome-dependent and autophagy-independent manner. We further confirmed that T-006 enhances proteasome activity by upregulating 20S proteasome subunit β5i (LMP7) protein expression. A functional study revealed that T-006 activates the PKA/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway to trigger LMP7 expression and enhance chymotrypsin-like proteasomal activity. These findings indicate that T-006 is a potent proteasome activator and a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of PD and related diseases.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313223	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313223	Alzheimer	5018472516978866574

Eisenmenger syndrome is a rare sequela of uncorrected congenital heart disease complicated by pulmonary hypertension, from which reversal of the pathologic left-to-right cardiovascular shunt and cyanosis follow. Right-to-left shunting can lead to paradoxical cerebral emboli-increasing the risk of spontaneous or iatrogenic stroke and cerebral abscess. A 38 year-old man presented with new focal seizures due to a brain abscess. Ventricular septal defect and pulmonary hypertension were identified. Despite dexamethasone and broad-spectrum antibiotics, he developed hemiparesis and altered mental status, and required emergent stereotactic abscess drainage. Despite the anesthetic hazards of Eisenmenger syndrome, the procedure was successful, and the patient recovered completely. Non-cardiac perioperative mortality in Eisenmenger syndrome is historically reported up to 19%, and risks are further increased with prolonged case duration or hypotension, mandating vigilant attention to volume status. Correspondingly, shorter or lower-risk procedures such as stereotactic drainage are recommended. Procedures should be performed only at centers with expertise in management of Eisenmenger syndrome and cardiac-specialized anesthesiologists whenever possible. Although a conservative approach with early, aggressive medical management is preferred, operative intervention may be required in the setting of progressive deterioration, and excellent postoperative outcomes are achievable.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31295595	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295595	heart+disease	8768619263229062922

2297	2297	156	Nature microbiology	CYRI/FAM49B negatively regulates RAC1-driven cytoskeletal remodelling and protects against bacterial infection.	Salmonella presents a global public health concern. Central to Salmonella pathogenicity is an ability to subvert host defences through strategically targeting host proteins implicated in restricting infection. Therefore, to gain insight into the host-pathogen interactions governing Salmonella infection, we performed an in vivo genome-wide mutagenesis screen to uncover key host defence proteins. This revealed an uncharacterized role of CYRI (FAM49B) in conferring host resistance to Salmonella infection. We show that CYRI binds to the small GTPase RAC1 through a conserved domain present in CYFIP proteins, which are known RAC1 effectors that stimulate actin polymerization. However, unlike CYFIP proteins, CYRI negatively regulates RAC1 signalling, thereby attenuating processes such as macropinocytosis, phagocytosis and cell migration. This enables CYRI to counteract Salmonella at various stages of infection, including bacterial entry into non-phagocytic and phagocytic cells as well as phagocyte-mediated bacterial dissemination. Intriguingly, to dampen its effects, the bacterial effector SopE, a RAC1 activator, selectively targets CYRI following infection. Together, this outlines an intricate host-pathogen signalling interplay that is crucial for determining bacterial fate. Notably, our study also outlines a role for CYRI in restricting infection mediated by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Listeria monocytogenes. This provides evidence implicating CYRI cellular functions in host defence beyond Salmonella infection.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31285585	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285585	tuberculosis	-2144625344076628986

Stress Granules (SGs) are macromolecular assemblies induced by stress and composed of proteins and mRNAs stalled in translation initiation. SGs play an important role in the response to stress and in the modulation of signaling pathways. Furthermore, these structures are related to the pathological ribonucleoprotein (RNP) aggregates found in neurodegenerative disease contexts, highlighting the need to understand how they are formed and recycled in normal and pathological contexts. Although genetically tractable multicellular organisms have been key in identifying modifiers of RNP aggregate toxicity, in vivo analysis of SG properties and regulation has lagged behind, largely due to the difficulty of detecting SG from images of intact tissues. Here, we describe the object detector software Obj.MPP and show how it overcomes the limits of classical object analyzers to extract the properties of SGs from wide-field and confocal images of respectively C. elegans and Drosophila tissues. We demonstrate that Obj.MPP enables the identification of genes modulating the assembly of endogenous and pathological SGs, and thus that it will be useful in the context of future genetic screens and in vivo studies.

The clinical management of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) remains ambiguous due to its heterogeneous presentations and its associations with liver disease, malignancy, and hypercoagulable states. The natural history and clinical outcome of PVT are highly variable, dependent upon size, extent and degree of the thrombotic occlusion, as well as the physiological impact of patient comorbidities. While existing clinical guidelines consistently recommend low molecular weight heparin or vitamin K antagonist anticoagulation in cirrhotic patients with symptomatic acute PVT, management of asymptomatic and chronic PVT may need to be determined on a case-by-case basis, factoring in the state of underlying liver disease. In general, patients with PVT and underlying malignancy should be anticoagulated to alleviate symptoms and prevent recurrences that could disrupt the cancer management. However, existing clinical data does not support routine anticoagulation of cirrhotic patients with asymptomatic PVT in the absence of underlying cancer. While low molecular weight heparin and vitamin K antagonist remain the most commonly used agents in PVT, an emerging body of clinical evidence now suggests that direct-acting oral anticoagulants may be used safely and effectively in PVT. As such, direct-acting oral anticoagulants may offer a more convenient anticoagulation alternative for PVT management in future practice.	2019	eng	Review	China	31293916	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293916	Cirrhosis	7985545205318799060

Endocrinology and metabolism	Overproduction of endothelin-1 impairs glucose tolerance but does not promote visceral adipose tissue inflammation or limit metabolic adaptations to exercise.	Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and proinflammatory peptide that is upregulated in obesity. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that ET-1 signaling promotes visceral adipose tissue (AT) inflammation and disrupts glucose homeostasis. We also tested if reduced ET-1 is a required mechanism by which exercise ameliorates AT inflammation and improves glycemic control in obesity. We found that (i) diet-induced obesity, AT inflammation, and glycemic dysregulation were not accompanied by significant increased levels of ET-1 in AT or circulation in wild-type mice; and that endothelial overexpression of ET-1 and consequent increased ET-1 levels did not cause AT inflammation yet impaired glucose tolerance; (ii) reduced AT inflammation and improved glucose tolerance with voluntary wheel running was not associated with decreased levels of ET-1 in AT or circulation in obese mice, nor did endothelial overexpression of ET-1 impede such exercise-induced metabolic adaptations; (iii) chronic pharmacological blockade of ET-1 receptors did not suppress AT inflammation in obese mice but improved glucose tolerance; and (iv) in a cohort of human subjects with a wide range of BMI, ET-1 levels in AT or circulation were not correlated with markers of inflammation in AT. In aggregate, we conclude that ET-1 signaling is not implicated in the development of visceral AT inflammation but promotes glucose intolerance, thus representing an important therapeutic target for glycemic dysregulation in conditions characterized by hyperendothelinemia. Furthermore, we show that the salutary effects of exercise on AT and systemic metabolic function are not contingent on the suppression of ET-1 signaling.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31310581	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310581	obesity	1266958185239582088
2316	2316	148	Anaesthesia	Determinants of women's dissatisfaction with anaesthesia care in labour and delivery.	Patient-centred care and factors associated with patient satisfaction with anaesthesia have been widely studied. However, the most important considerations in the setting of obstetric anaesthesia are uncertain. Identification of, and addressing, factors that contribute to patient dissatisfaction may improve quality of care. We sought to identify factors associated with < 100% satisfaction with obstetric anaesthesia care. At total of 4297 women treated by anaesthetists provided satisfaction data 24 h after vaginal and 48 h after caesarean delivery. As 78% of women were 100% satisfied, we studied factors associated with the dichotomous variable, 100% satisfied vs. < 100% satisfied. We evaluated patient characteristics and peripartum factors using multivariable sequential logistic regression. The following factors were strongly associated with maternal dissatisfaction after vaginal delivery: pain intensity during the first stage of labour; pain intensity during the second stage of labour; postpartum pain intensity; delay > 15 min in providing epidural analgesia and postpartum headache (all p < 0.0001). Pruritus (p = 0.005) also contributed to dissatisfaction after vaginal delivery, whereas non-Hispanic ethnicity was negatively associated with dissatisfaction (p = 0.01). After caesarean delivery, the intensity of postpartum pain (p < 0.0001), headache (p = 0.001) and pruritus (p = 0.001) were linked to dissatisfaction. Hispanic ethnicity also had a negative relationship with dissatisfaction after caesarean delivery (p = 0.005). Thus, inadequate or delayed analgesia and treatment-related side-effects are associated with maternal dissatisfaction with obstetric anaesthesia care. Development of protocols to facilitate identification of ineffective analgesia and provide an appropriate balance between efficacy and side-effects, are important goals to optimise maternal satisfaction.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31264207	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31264207	headache	-5414889822782394955

C2 toxin produced from Clostridium botulinum serotypes C and D has a potential role in many pathophysiological mechanisms in birds and animals. It has encompassed an ADP ribosyltransferase subunit (C2I) and a translocation/binding subunit (C2II). In the present study, we intended to produce C2I mutant proteins as recombinant subunit vaccines by using glutathione-S-transferase-gene fusion system. The mutants of this study were previously evaluated from their evolutionary imprints and suggested as suitable candidates for subunit vaccines. A synthetic C2 gene was inserted in a pGEX-2T vector, cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 host. The expressed mutant proteins were purified by using glutathione-agarose column and then examined for their ADP ribosyltransferase activity and vaccinogenic characteristics. The pGEX-2T-C2I constructs with Y298F, S347A and S350A substitutions have shown effective transformation efficiencies in E. coli XL10 competent cells but their mutagenesis efficiency was relatively low. Gene expression analysis indicated the rate of gene expression was depended on the fused mutant genes. A high-level expression was achieved for Y298F, S347A and S350A mutant proteins. All purified protein exhibited a molecular mass of 49 kDa. C2I mutant proteins exhibited a reduced ADP ribosyltransferase activity with retained immunogenic and vaccinogenic characteristics compared to the wild-type C2I subunit. The overall analysis of our study suggested the recombinant C2I proteins (S197A and Y298F) are the most promising candidates for the development of subunit vaccine or immunogen for C2 mutants mediated diseases in birds and animals.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31300115	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300115	vaccine	-1443900796086927361

Infections in the post-acute phase of cerebral ischaemia impede optimal recovery by exacerbating morbidity and mortality. Our review aims to reconcile the increased infection susceptibility of patients post-stroke by consolidating our understanding of compartmentalised alterations to systemic immunity. Mounting evidence has catalogued alterations to numerous immune cell populations but an understanding of the mechanisms of long-range communication between the immune system, nervous system and other organs beyond the involvement of autonomic signalling is lacking. By taking our cues from established and emerging concepts of neuro-immune interactions, immune-mediated inter-organ cross-talk, innate immune training and the role of microbiota-derived signals in central nervous system (CNS) function we will explore mechanisms of how cerebral ischaemia could shape systemic immune function. In this context, we will also discuss a key question: how are immune requirements critical for mediating repair of the ischaemic insult balanced by the need for anti-microbial immunity post-stroke, given that they are mediated by mutually exclusive immune networks? Our reformed understanding of the immune landscape post-stroke and novel mechanisms at play could guide targeted therapeutic interventions and initiate a step-change in the clinical management of these infectious complications post-stroke.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31312180	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312180	stroke	7932334249452694632

2336	2336	167	IUBMB life	Cholinergic and peptidergic neurotransmission in the adrenal medulla: A dynamic control of stimulus-secretion coupling.	Synaptic neurotransmission at the splanchnic nerve-chromaffin cell synapse is a chief element of the stimulus-secretion coupling in the adrenal medullary tissue, managing and regulating the secretion of catecholamines. Making the state of play more intricate than initially envisioned, the synaptic vesicles of nerve terminals innervating the medulla contain various compounds, including various neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Under basal conditions associated with a low splanchnic nerve discharge rate, neurotransmission is ensured by the synaptic release of the primary neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). Under sustained and repetitive stimulations of the splanchnic nerve, as triggered in response to stressors, the synaptic release of neuropeptides, such as the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide PACAP, supplants ACh release. The anatomical and functional changes that occur presynaptically at the preganglionic splanchnic nerve, combined with changes occurring postsynaptically at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), confer the adrenomedullary synapses a solid and persistent aptitude to functional remodeling, from birth to aging. The present review focuses on the composite cholinergic and noncholinergic nature of neurotransmission occurring at the splanchnic nerve-chromaffin cell synapse and its remodeling in response to physiological or pathological stimuli.	2019	eng	Review	England	31301221	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301221	aging	1537717759622831344

"Vaccines to generate durable humoral immunity against antigenically evolving pathogens such as the influenza virus must elicit antibodies that recognize conserved epitopes. Analysis of single memory B cells from immunized human donors has led us to characterize a previously unrecognized epitope of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) that is immunogenic in humans and conserved among influenza subtypes. Structures show that an unrelated antibody from a participant in an experimental infection protocol recognized the epitope as well. IgGs specific for this antigenic determinant do not block viral infection in vitro, but passive administration to mice affords robust IgG subtype-dependent protection against influenza infection. The epitope, occluded in the pre-fusion form of HA, is at the contact surface between HA head domains; reversible molecular ""breathing"" of the HA trimer can expose the interface to antibody and B cells. Antigens that present this broadly immunogenic HA epitope may be good candidates for inclusion in ""universal"" flu vaccines."	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31100267	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31100267	flu	9038543365726770177

2339	2339	253	Veterinary immunology and immunopathology	Felis catus papillomavirus type 2 virus-like particle vaccine is safe and immunogenic but does not reduce FcaPV-2 viral loads in adult cats.	Felis catus papillomavirus type 2 (FcaPV-2) commonly infects the skin of domestic cats and has been associated with the development of skin cancer. In the present study, a FcaPV-2 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine was produced and assessed for vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and impact on FcaPV-2 viral load. This is the first report of the use of a papillomavirus VLP vaccine in domestic cats. The FcaPV-2 VLP vaccine was given to ten adult cats that were naturally infected with FcaPV-2, and a further ten naturally infected cats were sham vaccinated as a control group. The rationale for vaccinating cats already infected with the virus was to induce neutralizing antibody titers that could prevent reinfection of new areas of skin and reduce the overall viral load, as has been demonstrated in other species. Reducing the overall FcaPV-2 viral load could reduce the risk for subsequent PV-associated cancer. The vaccine in this study was well-tolerated, as none of the cats developed any signs of local reaction or systemic illness. In the treatment group, the geometric mean anti-papillomavirus endpoint antibody titers increased significantly following vaccination from 606 (95% CI 192-1913) to 4223 (2023-8814), a 7.0-fold increase, although the individual antibody response varied depending on the level of pre-existing antibodies. Despite the immunogenicity of the vaccine, there was no significant change in FcaPV-2 viral load in the treatment group compared to the control group, over the 24 week follow-up period. A possible reason is that FcaPV-2 was already widespread in the basal skin layer of these adult cats and so preventing further cells from becoming infected had no impact on the overall viral load. Therefore, these results do not support the use of a FcaPV-2 VLP vaccine to reduce the risk for PV-associated cancer in cats in which FcaPV-2 infection is already well established. However, these results justify future studies in which the vaccine is administered to younger cats prior to FcaPV-2 infection becoming fully established.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31307673	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307673	vaccine	3328253785421705444

Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the major health problems of the aging male. The roles of dysregulated microRNAs in PCa remain unclear. In this study, we mined the public published data and found that miR-487a-3p was significantly downregulated in 38 pairs of clinical prostate tumor tissues compared with the normal tissues. We further verified this result by in situ hybridization on tissue chip and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in PCa/normal cells. miR-487a-3p targeting of cyclin D1 (CCND1) was identified using bioinformatics, qRT-PCR and western blot analyses. The cellular proliferation, cell cycle, migration, and invasion were assessed by cell counting kit-8, flow cytometry analysis and transwell assay. We discovered that overexpression of miR-487a-3p suppressed PCa cell growth, migration, invasion by directly targeting CCND1. Knockdown of CCND1 in PCa cells showed similar results. Meanwhile, the expression level of CCND1 was significantly upregulated in the PCa tissues and cell lines, which presented negative correlation with the expression of miR-487a-3p. More important, we demonstrated significantly reduced growth of xenograft tumors of stable miR-487a-3p-overexpressed human PCa cells in nude mice. Taken together, for the first time, our results revealed that miR-487a-3p as a tumor suppressor of PCa could target CCND1. Our finding might reveal miR-487a-3p could be potentially contributed to the pathogenesis and a clinical biomarker or the new potential therapeutic target of PCa.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31309555	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309555	aging	2435024834845042614

Kawasaki disease (KD) has features that appear supporting an infectious cause with a secondary deranged inflammatory/autoimmune response. The association of KD in adults with human immunodeficiency virus infection and the presence of KD in patients with immunodeficiency disorders support the infectious theory. We present four KD patients associated with immunodeficiencies: one with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, one with HIV infection, and two with leukemia; one of these patients also had Down syndrome. We did a literature search to find out all reported cases of immunodeficiency with KD in children. In immunodeficiency disorders, the inability of the immune system to eradicate the pathogens coupled to an exaggerated inflammatory response, especially in chronic granulomatous disease, may lead to the development of KD. The study of patients with immunodeficiencies complicated with KD may shed light into the etiopathogenesis of the disease.	2019	eng	Review	Germany	31312887	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312887	HIV	2602221055863892168

The aim of this work is to describe the history of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) concepts, from early descriptions in antiquity, through studies and authors from different historical periods throughout the centuries, to the latest updates of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). The article also presents the inclusion of the biomarkers from the cerebrospinal fluid, such as Tau and phosphorylated Tau proteins and beta-amyloid peptide in the most recent diagnostic criteria. A literature search was carried out in order to construct a reflexive narrative review of studies dated up to 2015 in the LILACS and Medline databases and with the inclusion of bibliographical references of the area. The different terms used throughout the history of the dementia and Alzheimer's disease concepts were contextualized according to the scientific perspective of a given epoch and its way of producing and reproducing knowledge. The concepts of dementia and AD continue to evolve, largely due to their complexity. Considering the importance and the growth of AD cases in the last and the next decades, this review may contribute in practice with the historical knowledge of the concepts related to dementia and AD.	2019	eng	Review	France	31174886	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174886	Alzheimer	3577117590019014785

The allergic airway diseases, including chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), asthma, allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM) and many others, comprise a heterogeneous collection of inflammatory disorders affecting the upper and lower airways and lung parenchyma that represent the most common chronic diseases of humanity. In addition to their shared tissue tropism, the allergic airway diseases are characterized by a distinct pattern of inflammation involving the accumulation of eosinophils, type 2 macrophages, innate lymphoid cells type 2 (ILC2), IgE-secreting B cells, and T helper type 2 (Th2) cells in airway tissues, and the prominent production of type 2 cytokines including interleukin (IL-) 33, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and many others. These factors and related inflammatory molecules induce characteristic remodeling and other changes of the airways that include goblet cell metaplasia, enhanced mucus secretion, smooth muscle hypertrophy, tissue swelling and polyp formation that account for the major clinical manifestations of nasal obstruction, headache, hyposmia, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, wheezing, and, in the most severe cases of lower airway disease, death due to respiratory failure or disseminated, systemic disease. The syndromic nature of the allergic airway diseases that now include many physiological variants or endotypes suggests that distinct endogenous or environmental factors underlie their expression. However, findings from different perspectives now collectively link these disorders to a single infectious source, the fungi, and a molecular pathogenesis that involves the local production of airway proteinases by these organisms. In this review, we discuss the evidence linking fungi and their proteinases to the surprisingly wide variety of chronic airway and systemic disorders and the immune pathogenesis of these conditions as they relate to environmental fungi. We further discuss the important implications these new findings have for the diagnosis and future therapy of these common conditions.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31296304	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296304	asthma	3456674717452933449

Pulmonary fibrosis is an emerging disease with a poor prognosis and high mortality rate that is even surpassing some types of cancer. This disease has been linked to the concomitant appearance of liver cirrhosis. Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis is a widely used mouse model that mimics the histopathological and biochemical features of human systemic sclerosis, an autoimmune disease that is associated with inflammation and expressed in several corporal systems as fibrosis or other alterations. To determine the effects on proliferation, redox and inflammation protein expression markers were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Analyses showed a significant increase in protein oxidation levels by lipoperoxidation bio-products and in proliferation and inflammation processes. These phenomena were associated with the induction of the redox status in mice subjected to 100 U/kg bleomycin. These findings clearly show that the bleomycin model induces histopathological alterations in the liver and partially reproduces the complexity of systemic sclerosis. Our results using the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model provide a protocol to investigate the mechanism underlying the molecular alteration found in the liver linked to systemic sclerosis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31312848	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312848	cancer	-8244000618837043328

Ultrasonography provides a minimally invasive method to evaluate the cervical lymph nodes in dogs as part of staging head and neck cancer; however, standardized cohesive reports of the normal lymph node size and appearance are lacking. The purpose of this prospective, descriptive, reference interval study was to characterize the ultrasonographic appearance of cervical lymph nodes in 27 clinically healthy dogs. The size, shape, echogenicity, and margination of the mandibular, medial retropharyngeal, and superficial cervical lymph nodes were evaluated and correlated with age, breed, sex, body weight, and stage of dental disease. The appearance of the lymph nodes was variable among the population. The majority were cigar or ovoid in shape with smooth margins. The echogenicity of the mandibular lymph nodes was predominantly hypoechoic whereas the medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes were predominantly isoechoic compared to the salivary glands. The superficial cervical lymph nodes were predominantly hyperechoic to the surrounding muscle bellies. Higher body weight and younger age were associated with increased size in the medial retropharyngeal and superficial cervical lymph nodes (P-values < .05). Sex and breed were not found to correlate with lymph node characteristics, and there was no trend noted in lymph node appearance associated with dental disease. These data establish normal parameters for the ultrasonographic size and appearance of cervical lymph nodes in dogs and can provide a reference of comparison for future canine cervical ultrasounds, which can be considered for routine staging procedures for head and neck cancer.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31313406	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313406	cancer	139485217095648183

2352	2352	406	Acta gastro-enterologica Belgica	The role and indications of albumin in advanced liver disease.	Low serum albumin is common in cirrhosis and is associated with a reduced survival. Moreover, in this setting, the native isoform of albumin can be severely reduced due to several posttranscriptional changes that impair the non-oncotic properties of the molecule. Due to its oncotic power, albumin acts as a powerful plasma expander. As such, it can antagonize the consequences of effective hypovolemia deriving from the systemic hemodynamics abnormalities that characterize advanced cirrhosis. Indeed, the current established indications to the use of albumin in this context pertain to conditions deriving from an acute drop of effective volemia. Recent advances have shown that the pathophysiological background of decompensated cirrhosis is characterized by a sustained systemic inflammatory and pro-oxidant state deriving by an abnormal bacterial translocation from the gut. These abnormalities ultimately lead to the multiorgan dysfunction. In this cascade of events, long-term albumin administration could act against several pathogenic factors through its non-oncotic properties, thus representing a potential multi-target mechanistic treatment. Over the last year, two randomized clinical trials on this topic were published. The ANSWER Trial demonstrated that the long-term albumin administration in patients with decompensated cirrhosis improves overall survival, reduces the incidence of complications and the need of hospitalizations and ameliorates the quality of life, being cost-effective. The MACHT trial challenged these results, but the differences between the two studies (sample size, baseline severity of cirrhosis, length of follow-up and amount of albumin administered) could explain its variant results, providing the basis for further insights into this matter.	2019	eng	Review	Belgium	31314192	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314192	Cirrhosis	-6312384811410586459

With the increasing number of cases of latent and drug resistant tuberculosis, there is an urgent need to develop new, potent molecules capable of combating this deadly disease. Molecules containing oxadiazoles are one such class that could be considered to fulfil this need. Oxadiazole regioisomers have been explored in drug discovery programs for their ability to act as effective linkers and also as pharmacophoric features. Oxadiazoles can act as bioisosteric replacements for the hydrazide moiety which can be found in first line anti-TB drugs, and some have been also reported to interact with newer anti-TB targets. In this context, the present review describes the potential of oxadiazoles as antituberculosis agents.	2019	eng	Review	England	31296357	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296357	tuberculosis	9124439338148818380

Background and Purpose- Hypercoagulable states in migraine patients may play a role in the pathophysiology underlying the association between migraine and ischemic stroke. This study aims to provide more insight into the potential association of headache, ischemic stroke, and the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Methods- We included patients from the RATIO study (Risk of Arterial Thrombosis in Relation to Oral Contraceptives), a Dutch population-based case-control study including young women (age <50) with ischemic stroke and healthy controls. We defined a headache group based on a questionnaire on headache history. Intrinsic coagulation proteins were measured through both antigen levels (FXII, FXI, prekallikrein, HK [high molecular weight kininogen]) and protein activation, determined by measuring activated protein complex with C1esterase-inhibitor (FXIIa-C1-INH, FXIa-C1-INH, Kallikrein-C1-INH) or antitrypsin-inhibitor (FXIa-AT-INH). We calculated adjusted odds ratios and performed an interaction analysis assessing the increase in stroke risk associated with high levels of intrinsic coagulation and history of headache. Results- We included 113 ischemic stroke cases and 598 healthy controls. In total, 134 (19%) patients had a history of headache, of whom 38 were cases and 96 controls. The combination of headache and high intrinsic coagulation protein levels (all but FXII antigen level and both FXIa-inhibitors) was associated with an increase in ischemic stroke risk higher than was expected based on their individual effects (adjusted odds ratio FXI antigen level alone: 1.7, 95% CI, 1.0-2.9; adjusted odds ratio headache alone: 2.0, 95% CI, 1.1-3.7; combination: 5.2, 95% CI, 2.3-11.6) Conclusions- Headache and high intrinsic coagulation protein levels may biologically interact, increasing risk for ischemic stroke.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31284847	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284847	headache	-2703878216681968882

2364	2364	378	BioMed research international	Neutrophilic Dermatoses and Their Implication in Pathophysiology of Asthma and Other Respiratory Comorbidities: A Narrative Review.	Neutrophilic dermatoses (ND) are a polymorphous group of noncontagious dermatological disorders that share the common histological feature of a sterile cutaneous infiltration of mature neutrophils. Clinical manifestations can vary from nodules, pustules, and bulla to erosions and ulcerations. The etiopathogenesis of neutrophilic dermatoses has continuously evolved. Accumulating genetic, clinical, and histological evidence point to NDs being classified in the spectrum of autoinflammatory conditions. However, unlike the monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes where a clear multiple change in the inflammasome structure/function is demonstrated, NDs display several proinflammatory abnormalities, mainly driven by IL-1, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). Additionally, because of the frequent association with extracutaneous manifestations where neutrophils seem to play a crucial role, it was plausible also to consider NDs as a cutaneous presentation of a systemic neutrophilic condition. Neutrophilic dermatoses are more frequently recognized in association with respiratory disorders than by chance alone. The combination of the two, particularly in the context of their overlapping immune responses mediated primarily by neutrophils, raises the likelihood of a common neutrophilic systemic disease or an aberrant innate immunity disorder. Associated respiratory conditions can serve as a trigger or may develop or be exacerbated secondary to the uncontrolled skin disorder. Physicians should be aware of the possible pulmonary comorbidities and apply this knowledge in the three steps of patients' management, work-up, diagnosis, and treatment. In this review, we attempt to unravel the pathophysiological mechanisms of this association and also present some evidence for the role of targeted therapy in the treatment of both conditions.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31281845	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31281845	asthma	-5750828394349042089

A systematic search was conducted in electronic databases using obesity as the main term along with anthocyanins and the main anthocyanidins, including articles in Portuguese, English, and Spanish without any restriction as to year. The review was carried out by peers following PRISMA recommendations: 1980 studies were identified, and 19 articles were analyzed. The studies varied in relation to time, pathways, cells used, and anthocyanin types. The positive effects were observed in 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase pathways and mitochondrial biogenesis and in a reduction in inflammation and oxidative stress. Anthocyanins can improve the metabolic control involved in obesity by reducing lipogenesis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. This can boost the speed of lipolysis and thermogenesis, regulate satiety, and reduce body fat accumulation. In addition, anthocyanins have shown promising effects on controlling obesity compared with the standard of care.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31310961	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310961	obesity	7216750853471801538

"Computational modelling has made significant progress towards clinical application in recent years. In addition to providing detailed diagnostic data, these methods have the potential to simulate patient-specific interventions and to predict their outcome. Our objective was to evaluate to which extent patient-specific modelling influences treatment decisions in coarctation of the aorta (CoA), a common congenital heart disease. We selected three cases with CoA, two of which had borderline indications for intervention according to current clinical guidelines. The third case was not indicated for intervention according to guidelines. For each case, we generated two separate datasets. First dataset included conventional diagnostic parameters (echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging). In the second, we added modelled parameters (pressure fields). For the two cases with borderline indications for intervention, the second dataset also included pressure fields after virtual stenting simulations. All parameters were computed by modelling methods that were previously validated. In an online-administered, invitation-only survey, we randomized 178 paediatric cardiologists to view either conventional (control) or add-on modelling (experimental) datasets. Primary endpoint was the proportion of participants recommending different therapeutic options: (1) surgery or catheter lab (collectively, ""intervention"") or (2) no intervention (follow-up with or without medication). Availability of data from computational predictive modelling influenced therapeutic decision making in two of three cases. There was a statistically significant association between group assignment and the recommendation of an intervention for one borderline case and one non-borderline case: 94.3% vs. 72.2% (RR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.14-1.50, "	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31304365	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304365	heart+disease	7993526700719577624

In this study, a Bayesian optimization based computational framework is developed to investigate the design of transcatheter aortic valve (TAV) leaflets and to optimize leaflet geometry such that its peak stress under the blood pressure of 120 mmHg is reduced. A generic TAV model is parametrized by mathematical equations describing its 2D shape and its 3D stent-leaflet assembly line. Material properties previously obtained for bovine (BP) and porcine pericardium (PP) via a combination of flexural and biaxial tensile testing were incorporated into the finite element (FE) model of TAV. A Bayesian optimization approach was employed to investigate about 1000 leaflet designs for each material under the nominal circular deployment and physiological loading conditions. The optimal parameter values of the TAV model were obtained, corresponding to leaflet shapes that can reduce the peak stress by 16.7% in BP and 18.0% in PP, compared with that from the initial generic TAV model. Furthermore, it was observed that while peak stresses tend to concentrate near the stent-leaflet attachment edge, optimized geometries benefit from more uniform stress distributions in the leaflet circumferential direction. Our analysis also showed that increasing leaflet contact area redistributes peak stresses to the belly region contributing to peak stress reduction.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic progressive systemic disease caused by a metabolic disorder. In recent years, a large number of studies have shown that certain traditional Chinese medicines and their bioactive ingredients have obvious hypoglycemic effects. This literature review focuses on medicine food homology (MFH) and medicinal health food (MHF) species used in China with a hypoglycemic function and emphasizes the bioactive ingredients and their pharmacological effects. The bioactive ingredients of MFH and MHF have been divided into six categories: saponins, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, polysaccharides, and others; and their sources, models, efficacy, and mechanisms of action have been described. It is noteworthy that the mechanisms of the bioactive ingredients of MFH and MHF with hypoglycemic effects have been summarized as follows: a) insulin-mimetic effects and restoration of the damaged pancreas; b) effect on glucose metabolism; c) increased insulin sensitivity and improved insulin resistance; and d) regulation of intestinal flora. We conclude that this review provides useful data and information to support the further investigation and application of MFH and MHF to treat DM.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31309854	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309854	diabetes	6915731723505426291

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) can impair healing of diabetic foot (DF) in patients with diabetes mellitus. To determine whether carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) can predict lower limb arterial lesions in patients with DF, this cross-sectional study enrolled patients with DF at West China Hospital (China) between January 2012 and December 2015. Ultrasonography was used to measure CIMT, assess the internal carotid arteries (ICA) for plaques, and evaluate lower limb segmental arteries for stenosis. The optimal CIMT cutoff for detecting lower limb PAD was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Factors associated with PAD were identified by logistic regression analyses. A total of 167 patients (mean age: 69.7±10.3 years; 102 men) were included. Patients with PAD were older and had higher levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein than patients without PAD (P<0.05). The area under the ROC curve was 0.747 (P<0.001). At the optimal CIMT cutoff of 0.71 mm, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 79.65, 61.11, 81.08, and 58.93%, respectively. Compared with those without PAD, more patients with PAD had CIMT ≥0.71 mm (79.65 vs 38.89%; P<0.001) and ICA plaques (66.37vs 11.11%; P<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.118; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.056-1.183; P<0.001), ICA plaques (OR: 13.452; 95%CI: 4.450-40.662; P<0.001), and CIMT ≥0.71 mm (OR: 2.802; 95%CI: 1.092-7.188; P=0.032) were associated with PAD.CIMT may be a surrogate marker of PAD in patients with DF.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Brazil	31314853	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314853	diabetes	-1676378465482420452

Research on the drivers of vaccine acceptance has expanded but most interventions fall short of coverage targets. We explored whether vaccine uptake is driven directly or indirectly by disgust with attitudes towards vaccines acting as a possible mediator. An online cross-sectional study of 1007 adults of the USA via Amazon's Mechanical Turk was conducted in January 2017. The questionnaire consisted of four sections: (1) items assessing attitudes towards vaccines and vaccine uptake, (2) revised Disgust Scale (DS-R) to measure Disgust Sensitivity, (3) Perceived Vulnerability to Disease scale (PVD) to measure Germ Aversion and Perceived Susceptibility, and (4) socio-demographic information. Using mediation analysis, we assess the direct, the indirect (through Vaccine Attitudes) and the total effect of Disgust Sensitivity, Germ Aversion and Perceived Susceptibility on 2016 self-reported flu vaccine uptake. Mediation analysis showed the effect of Disgust Sensitivity and Germ Aversion on vaccine uptake to be twofold: a direct positive effect on vaccine uptake and an indirect negative effect through Vaccine Attitudes. In contrast, Perceived Susceptibility was found to have only a direct positive effect on vaccine uptake. Nonetheless, these effects were attenuated and small compared to economic, logistic and psychological determinants of vaccine uptake.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31063117	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063117	flu	-7442296890640709658

Human tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases with accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated and aggregated tau proteins forming neurofibrillary tangles. We investigated the development of tau pathology in aged cat brains as a model of neurofibrillary tangle formation occurring spontaneously during aging. In 4 of 6 cats aged between 18 and 21 years, we found a somatodendritic accumulation of phosphorylated and aggregated tau in neurons and oligodendrocytes. Two of these 4 cats had no amyloid immunoreactivity. These tau inclusions were mainly composed of 4R tau isoforms and straight filaments and colocalized with the active form of the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3). Cat brains with a tau pathology showed a significant cortical atrophy and neuronal loss. We demonstrate in this study the presence of a tau pathology in aged cat brains that develop independently of amyloid deposits. The colocalization of the active form of the GSK3 with tau inclusions as observed in human tauopathies suggests that this kinase could be responsible for the abnormal tau phosphorylation observed in aged cat brains, representing a mechanism of tau pathology development shared between a naturally occurring tauopathy in aged cats and human tauopathies.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31306814	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306814	aging	-8052188270551570124

"Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common and serious neuropsychiatric complication of cirrhosis, acute liver failure, and porto-systemic shunting. HE largely contributes to the morbidity of patients with liver disease, severely affecting the quality of life of both patients and their relatives and being associated with poor prognosis. Its presentation is largely variable, manifesting with a broad spectrum of cognitive abnormalities ranging from subtle cognitive impairment to coma. The pathogenesis of HE is complex and has historically been linked with hyperammonemia. However, in the last years, it has become evident that the interplay of multiple actors, such as intestinal dysbiosis, gut hyperpermeability, and neuroinflammation, is of crucial importance in its genesis. Therefore, HE can be considered a result of a dysregulated gut-liver-brain axis function, where cognitive impairment can be reversed or prevented by the beneficial effects induced by ""gut-centric"" therapies, such as non-absorbable disaccharides, non-absorbable antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation. In this context dietary modifications, by modulating the intestinal milieu, can also provide significant benefit to cirrhotic patients with HE. This review will provide a comprehensive insight into the mechanisms responsible for gut-liver-brain axis dysregulation leading to HE in cirrhosis. Furthermore, it will explore the currently available therapies and the most promising future treatments for the management of patients with HE, with a special focus on the dietary approach."	2019	eng	Review	United States	31293718	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293718	Cirrhosis	7510090557616166004

Maternal immunization during pregnancy provide protection for the mother and the fetus against certain pathogens. Immunizations during pregnancy are divided to routine immunizations recommended for all pregnant women, immunizations for certain medical indications and vaccines that are potentially harmful during pregnancy and should be avoided. We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature regarding immunizations during pregnancy. The search terms used were immunization, vaccine, pregnancy, influenza, pertussis, safety and efficacy. We gathered all available guidelines on vaccination during pregnancy. Generally, vaccines are allowed during pregnancy when the benefits outweigh the risks. Tdap and inactivated flu vaccines are routinely recommended during pregnancy. Vaccines containing live attenuated viruses are contraindicated during pregnancy. These are LAIV influenza, MMR, Varicella, Zoster, BCG and smallpox pre-exposure. All other vaccines are given when medically indicated and the possible benefits outweigh the risks. Obstetricians and gynecologists should be familiar with the indications of vaccination during pregnancy. Vaccination coverage of pregnant women with routinely recommended vaccines has increased but further efforts are needed. Our aim is to review vaccination practices during pregnancy, demonstrate the benefits and dangers of different vaccines, evaluate their effectiveness and define the proper timing of vaccination.	2019	eng	Review	Ireland	31226574	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31226574	flu	-5628343274127925011

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women world wide and its incidence is on tremendous increase. The present study is aimed to analyze the dose-dependent chemopreventive efficacy of citronellol on 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced rat mammary carcinogenesis. The mammary tumor was induced through a single dose of DMBA (25 mg/rat) injected subcutaneously near the mammary gland of rats. In DMBA-injected rats, 100% tumor incidence, increased tumor volume, and tumor burden along with loss of body weight were observed. Biochemical analysis revealed the increased levels of phase I detoxification proteins (cytochrome P450 and b5) and decreased activities of phase II detoxification enzymes (glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione reductase) in hepatic and mammary tissues. The levels of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants (superoxidedismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and (GPx) and reduced glutathione) were decreased and lipid peroxidation by-products (thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and lipid hydroperoxide) got increased in plasma and mammary tissues. Oral administration of different doses of citronellol (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg body weight) to DMBA-treated rats for 16 weeks absolutely inhibited the tumor incidence and restored the biochemical parameters near to normal level in 50 and 100 mg doses whereas the histopathological studies also supported the biochemical findings. Hence, the result suggests that the citronellol of 50 mg/kg body weight exerted significant chemopreventive effects and can be considered as a minimum optimum dose in the prevention of mammary carcinogenesis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313341	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313341	cancer	-6207670654614839859

Cigarettes are well-recognized risk factors responsible for the emergence of a variety of pathologic conditions affecting both the airways and the lungs. Smoking-related lung diseases can be classified as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and several types of interstitial diseases, such as pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, bronchiolitis, desquamative interstitial pneumonitis, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, and interstitial fibrosing lung diseases. The evidence of combined lower lung fibrosis and predominant upper lung emphysema is renowned as a distinct clinical entity, named combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema. Although computerized tomography permits an adequate classification and distinction of these diseases, the clinical, imaging, and histological features often overlap and coexist in a single patient. Therefore, a combined radiologic and pathologic approach, in the appropriate clinical setting, is useful for best comprehension and distinction of these entities. Our goals are to describe the imaging features in smoking-related lung diseases and how the pathological manifestations translate on high-resolution computerized tomography.	2019	eng	Review	Germany	31312909	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312909	smoking	5395868751435718725

The rates of obesity and its related comorbidities have increased substantially over the last 30 years, with approximately 35% of all US adults now classified as obese. Whilst the causes of obesity are both complex and multifactorial, one contributor is a reduction in leisure time physical activity, with no concurrent reduction in energy intake. Physical activity interventions have been demonstrated to promote fat loss, yet more than 50% of US adults undertake no leisure time physical activity at all, with a lack of time and enjoyment often cited as the main drivers of rising inactivity levels. Furthermore, recent evidence has demonstrated that a sub-group of individuals may experience no improvement in a given fitness or health-related measure following a specific training programme, suggesting that there may be optimal exercise types for different groups of individuals. In this paper, we introduce the concept of exercise response efficiency, whereby individuals are matched to the training type from which they are most likely to derive the greatest improvements for the least time commitment. We propose that a more precise targeting of exercise interventions is likely to drive more rapid improvements in health, thereby promoting exercise adherence and enjoyment, whilst simultaneously reducing obesity and mortality risks. Such an innovation would, we suggest, confer important public health benefits.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31302657	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302657	obesity	5410293063635507608

Infective endocarditis in patients with CHD is an ongoing clinical challenge. In contemporary practice in tertiary congenital centers, 1 of 15 patients do not survive to hospital discharge. Streptococci remain the most common causative organism, and antecedent dental or medical procedures were undertaken in a significant minority in the 3 months before diagnosis. The presence of an atrioventricular septal defect or staphylococcal infection is associated with significantly increased risk of early mortality.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31299559	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299559	heart+disease	8240934591713322028
2406	2406	113	Cancer medicine	Assessment on clinical value of prostate health index in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.	In this study, we performed a comprehensive estimation and assessment for the clinical value of prostate health index (PHI) in diagnosing prostate cancer. Using the bivariate mixed-effect model, we calculated the following parameters and their 95% confidence internals (CIs), including sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio and symmetric receiver operator characteristic. Twenty eligible studies with a total number of 5543 subjects were included in the final analysis. The estimated sensitivity was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.70-0.79) and the specificity was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.58-0.83). The pooled area under the curve was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74-0.81). The combined positive likelihood ratio was 2.45 (95% CI: 2.19-2.73) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.36 (95% CI: 0.31-0.43). The diagnostic odds ratio was 6.73 (95% CI: 5.38-8.44). The posttest probability was 40% under the present positive likelihood ratio of 2.45. It seems there was no significant difference between Asian population and Caucasian population population in sensitivity and specificity. But the overlap of AUC 95% CI indicated that the diagnostic accuracy of PHI was slightly higher in the Asian population population setting than that in the Caucasian population population population (0.83 vs 0.76). Similarly, there was also overlap in AUC 95% CI, which suggested that sample size may be one of heterogeneity source. The PHI has a moderate diagnostic accuracy for detecting prostate cancer. The discrimination ability of PHI is slightly prior to free/total prostate-specific antigen. It seems that ethnicity has an influence on the clinical value of PHI in the diagnostic of prostate cancer.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313500	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313500	cancer	174707786647990372

2408	2408	327	NPJ science of food	Food for thought: how nutrition impacts cognition and emotion.	More than one-third of American adults are obese and statistics are similar worldwide. Caloric intake and diet composition have large and lasting effects on cognition and emotion, especially during critical periods in development, but the neural mechanisms for these effects are not well understood. A clear understanding of the cognitive-emotional processes underpinning desires to over-consume foods can assist more effective prevention and treatments of obesity. This review addresses recent work linking dietary fat intake and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid dietary imbalance with inflammation in developing, adult, and aged brains. Thus, early-life diet and exposure to stress can lead to cognitive dysfunction throughout life and there is potential for early nutritional interventions (e.g., with essential micronutrients) for preventing these deficits. Likewise, acute consumption of a high-fat diet primes the hippocampus to produce a potentiated neuroinflammatory response to a mild immune challenge, causing memory deficits. Low dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can also contribute to depression through its effects on endocannabinoid and inflammatory pathways in specific brain regions leading to synaptic phagocytosis by microglia in the hippocampus, contributing to memory loss. However, encouragingly, consumption of fruits and vegetables high in polyphenolics can prevent and even reverse age-related cognitive deficits by lowering oxidative stress and inflammation. Understanding relationships between diet, cognition, and emotion is necessary to uncover mechanisms involved in and strategies to prevent or attenuate comorbid neurological conditions in obese individuals.	2017	eng	Review	England	31304249	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304249	depression	8779890754987103603

HIV prevalence is high among transgender women (TW), but how HIV is transmitted to this population is not well understood. This analysis aims to characterize sexual partners of TW (PTW) to understand how their behavior contributes to HIV risk among TW. We examined baseline data from TW, PTW, and men who have sex with men (MSM) from a treatment-as-prevention study in Lima, Peru. Individual and partnership characteristics were compared across groups, and Poisson regression was used to calculate prevalence ratios for associations between sexual concurrency and potential correlates. We found that 81% of PTW had no cisgender male partners. Prevalence of alcohol dependency, concurrency, and condomless anal intercourse was high and HIV testing was low compared to the other groups. Our results suggest that PTW are a distinct population from MSM and TW, engage in behavior associated with HIV transmission, and are likely not well reached by HIV prevention interventions.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31300977	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300977	HIV	6587635730509289343

There is controversy over the role of S-nitrosylation in aging and specifically whether GSNOR expression levels decline into middle age, and whether increased GSNOR levels observed in old mice and humans confer a survival benefit or are detrimental. Significant work is necessary to develop appropriate mouse models with tunable GSNOR expression as well as increased scrutiny of human epidemiological data in order to establish GSNOR as a longevity gene. For the present, it may be most useful to view GSNOR as a key cell signaling modulator that must be maintained in a narrow range in appropriate tissue contexts to maintain homeostasis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31298613	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298613	aging	886450434856305025

2421	2421	738	Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)	Perspective: Public Health Nutrition Policies Should Focus on Healthy Eating, Not on Calorie Counting, Even to Decrease Obesity.	Calorie-focused policies, such as calorie menu labeling, seem to result in minor shifts toward healthier choices and public health improvement. This paper discusses the (lack of) relations between energy intake and healthy eating and the rationale for shifting the focus of public health nutrition policies to healthier foods and meals. We argue that the benefits of reducing caloric intake from low-quality foods might not result from the calorie reduction but rather from the reduced consumption of low-quality foods. It is better to consume a given number of calories from high-quality foods than a smaller number of calories from low-quality foods. It is not possible to choose a healthy diet solely based on the caloric value of foods because calories are not equal; they differ in nutritional quality according to their source. Foods are more than just a collection of calories and nutrients, and nutrients interact differently when presented as foods. Different subtypes of a macronutrient, although they have the same caloric value, are metabolized and influence health in different ways. For instance, industrial trans fats increase lipogenesis and the risk of heart diseases, whereas monounsaturated fats have the opposite effect. Food processing and cooking methods also influence the nutritional value of foods. Thus, public health nutrition policies should stop encouraging people to focus mainly on calorie counting to fight noncommunicable diseases. Instead, policies should focus on ingredients, dietary sources, and food processing and cooking methods.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31305908	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305908	obesity	-7191607771634445823

2428	2428	39	Virus research	Emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses with the novel S genes in Tibetan pigs in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in China.	The purpose of present study was to investigate the prevalence and genetic variation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in Tibetan pigs on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in 2018. The PCR yielded a significantly high detection rate (38.34%, 95%CI=31.5-45.6%) for PEDV from 193 fecal samples from Tibetan pigs. The novel PEDVs were discovered in Tibetan pigs and seven complete S genes were obtained and analyzed. The unique multiple mutations were detected in S genes of PEDV from Tibetan pigs, one of which led to a new amino acid substitution of a neutralizing epitope. Phylogenetic analysis showed that seven S genes had significant genetic distance to other PEDV. Specially, two S genes formed a novel subgroup on the genogroup 2 (G2) branch, of which same recombination event occurred between different strains from genotype G2. The remaining five S genes formed a new subgroup on the G1 branch, among which distinct recombination events occurred between genotypes G1 and G2 strains. The result indicated that the new recombination events were detected in the S genes of PEDV from Tibetan pigs, which could be circulating in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Notably, the four complete PEDV genomes obtained in this study had an identical recombination region spanning S2, ORF3 and E genes. This is the first report of the crossover regional recombination event in PEDV genome. Our findings not only augmented current understanding of the genetic evolution of PEDV, but also indicated that new variants of PEDV strains have been emerging in Tibetan pigs.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31301333	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301333	Diarrhea	-7838000919054582150

2431	2431	308	JCI insight	SREBP-regulated adipocyte lipogenesis is dependent on substrate availability and redox modulation of mTORC1.	The synthesis of lipid and sterol species through de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is regulated by two functionally overlapping but distinct transcription factors: the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP). ChREBP is considered to be the dominant regulator of DNL in adipose tissue (AT); however, the SREBPs are highly expressed and robustly regulated in adipocytes, suggesting that the model of AT DNL may be incomplete. Here we describe a new mouse model of inducible, adipocyte-specific overexpression of the insulin-induced gene 1 (Insig1), a negative regulator of SREBP transcriptional activity. Contrary to convention, Insig1 overexpression did block AT lipogenic gene expression. However, this was immediately met with a compensatory mechanism triggered by redox activation of mTORC1 to restore SREBP1 DNL gene expression. Thus, we demonstrate that SREBP1 activity sustains adipocyte lipogenesis, a conclusion that has been elusive due to the constitutive nature of current mouse models.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31310592	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310592	diabetes	-3850803681204406658

In this study, we provide new insights into the mechanism of catalysis, substrate specificity and inhibition of SapM, and we identify the critical residues for catalysis and substrate binding.

Pneumococcal meningitis is a global scourge. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. In Morocco, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was introduced into the National Immunization Program in October 2010 according to the immunization schedule 2 + 1 and replaced by PCV10 in July 2012, according to the same schedule. Despite the use of the PCV13, which is essential in the fight against pneumococcal disease, the emergence of new non-vaccine serotypes always results in meningitis in children, causing serious sequelae. We report the case of an infant vaccinated with two doses of PCV13 with meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 7a. The peculiarity of this case study lies in pneumococcal meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 7a not included in the PCV13 in an infant immunized by 2 doses of PCV13. We here insist on the need and the importance of an observatory for pneumococcal meningitis and of a wide epidemiological study in order to determine the serotypes in Morocco after the introduction of PCV13 and then of PCV10.	2019	fre	English Abstract	Uganda	31312315	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312315	vaccine	1233935898842140014

The profound sadness endured by families is compounded by the risk many of these deaths confer upon surviving relatives. For those with known cardiac disease, disease-specific therapy and risk stratification are key to reducing sudden death. For families of a SCD victim, uncovering a definitive cause of death can help relieve the agonising uncertainty and is a vital first step in screening surviving relatives and instituting therapy to reduce SCD risk. Increasing knowledge about the molecular mechanisms and genetic drivers of malignant arrhythmias in the diverse clinical entities that can cause SCD is vital if we are to optimise risk stratification and personalise patient care. Advances in diagnostic tools, disease-specific therapy and defibrillator technology are improving outcomes for patients and their families but there is still much progress to be made.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Australia	31295785	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295785	heart+disease	-8202212195240926680

The rise of multi- and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) strains and co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus has escalated the need for new anti-M. tb drugs. Numerous challenges associated with the M. tb, in particular slow growth and pathogenicity level 3, discouraged use of this organism in past primary screening efforts. From current knowledge of the physiology and drug susceptibility of mycobacteria in general and M. tb specifically, it can be assumed that many potentially useful drug leads were missed by failing to screen directly against this pathogen. This review discusses recent high-throughput phenotypic screening strategies for anti-M. tb drug discovery. Emphasis is placed on prioritization of hits, including their extensive biological and chemical profiling, as well as the development status of promising drug candidates discovered with phenotypic screening.	2019	eng	Review	Japan	31292530	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292530	tuberculosis	8748370453256790422

The objective of this study is to characterize changes in the fate, behaviour and bioavailability of four conazole fungicides - CFs (prochloraz - PRO, tebuconazole - TEB, epoxiconazole - EPO, flusilazole - FLU) in 12 diverse agricultural soils in complex microcosm systems consisting of agriculturally-used fluvisols, plants (Lactuca sativa), earthworms (Eisenia fetida) and passive samplers (SPME, Empore™ discs, silicone rubber). Due to great variability of the data and other methodological problems, the in-matrix passive samplers failed to be indicators of pore-water concentration and (bio)availability/(bio)accessibility of CFs. A dissipation of all CFs followed the first order kinetics (usually after initial lag phase) with large span of resulting half-lives (7-670 d) depending on soils and compounds. In many soils, the model revealed the ending plateau, which indicates the non-degradable or slowly-degradable residues. The half-lives and the residues were generally higher for EPO and FLU, than for PRO and TEB. Greater but slower total dissipation of CFs was observed in soils with higher percentage of organic matter. Earthworm concentrations were highest at first sampling time (14 days) and considerably decreased afterwards often resulting in PRO concentration below LOQ. Earthworm uptake was influenced by amount of organic matter and soil texture. Accumulation to lettuce roots was generally higher than to leaves and differed greatly among CFs. Concentration shoot to root ratios were generally the lowest for FLU (0.04) and highest for TEB (0.37). PRO was not detected in lettuce leaves during experiment. The study brings new results on fate and bioavailability of CFs in soils.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31108446	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31108446	flu	5817939718364925129

Human adenovirus type 4 (HAdV4) is an etiological agent of acute respiratory disease (ARD) in pediatric and adult patients. HAdV4 strains can be divided into two major genomic clusters, namely prototype (p)-like viruses and a-like viruses. Here, the complete genome sequence of HAdV4 strain GZ01, isolated from a child with ARD in southern China, is first reported and analyzed. This strain was determined to be of the 4a1 genome-type based on in silico restriction profiles. Then, a replication-competent rAd4DsRed virus, containing the HAdV4 GZ01 infectious genome and expressing the reporter molecule DsRed, was generated and characterized. Recombinant rAd4DsRed can infect AD293, hamster, and mouse cells in which DsRed protein was expressed. No changes in antigenicity and genome replication were detected for rAd4DsRed and wild-type HAdV4. Mice immunized with rAd4DsRed was elicited a marked antibody response to DsRed. A rapid method of testing neutralizing antibodies against HAdV3 and HAdV4 was also established using a mixture of rAd4DsRed and rAd3EGFP. Our results provide the foundation to develop HAdV4 vaccines, potential vector platforms for vaccine and gene therapy, and rapid methods for serological and antiviral screening.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31301331	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301331	vaccine	2628816849077589497

While the role of the cerebellum in emotion recognition has been explored with facial expressions, its involvement in the auditory modality (i.e., emotional prosody) remains to be demonstrated. The present study investigated the recognition of emotional prosody in 15 patients with chronic cerebellar ischaemic stroke and 15 matched healthy controls, using a validated task, as well as clinical, motor, neuropsychological, and psychiatric assessments. We explored the cerebellar lesion-behaviour relationship using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. Results showed a significant difference between the stroke and healthy control groups, with patients giving erroneous ratings on the Surprise scale when they listened to fearful stimuli. Moreover, voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping revealed that these emotional misattributions correlated with lesions in right Lobules VIIb, VIII and IX. Interestingly, the posterior cerebellum has previously been found to be involved in affective processing, and Lobule VIIb in rhythm discrimination. These results point to the cerebellum's functional involvement in vocal emotion decoding.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31306617	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306617	stroke	-7527881206365368

This study reports a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) effect of amyloid-like peptides, having a signal equivalent to or even higher than those of endogenous collagen fibers. Several amyloid-like peptides (both synthetic and natural) were examined under SHG microscopy and shown they are SHG-active. These peptides can also be observed inside cells (in vitro). This interesting property can make these amyloid-like peptides second harmonic probes for bioimaging applications. Furthermore, SHG microscopy can provide a simple and label-free approach to detect amyloidosis. Lattice corneal dystrophy was chosen as a model disease of amyloidosis.

Social environments have been shown to have multiple effects on individual immune responses. For example, increased social contact might signal greater infection risk and prompt a prophylactic upregulation of immunity. This differential investment of resources may in part explain why social environments affect ageing and lifespan. Our previous work using Drosophila melanogaster showed that single-sex social contact reduced lifespan for both sexes. Here, we assess how social interactions (isolation or contact) affect susceptibility to infection, phagocytotic activity and expression of a subset of immune and stress related genes in young and old flies of both sexes. Social contact had a neutral, or even improved, effect on post-infection lifespan in older flies and reduced the expression of stress response genes in females, however it reduced phagocytotic activity. Overall the effects of social environment were complex and largely subtle, and do not indicate a consistent effect. Together, these findings indicate that social contact in D. melanogaster does not have a predictable impact on immune responses and does not simply trade-off immune investment with lifespan.

Macrophages are pivotal cells of the innate immune system specialized in the phagocytosis of foreign elements. Nanoparticles intentionally designed to target macrophages and modulate their response are of especial interest in the case of chronic inflammatory diseases, cancer and for vaccine development. This work aimed to understand the role of size and shell composition of polymeric nanocapsules (NCs) in their interaction with macrophages, both in vitro and in vivo. A systematic study was performed using two different sizes of inulin and chitosan NCs, negatively and positively charged, respectively, small (≈ 70 nm) and medium (170-250 nm). The in vitro results showed that small NCs interacted more efficiently with macrophages than their larger counterparts. Inulin NCs were significantly less toxic than chitosan NCs. Finally, following in vivo administration (intravenous/intramuscular) to zebrafish, small NCs, regardless of their composition, disseminated considerably faster and further than their medium size counterparts. These results emphasize how small changes in the nanometric range can lead to a remarkably different interaction with the immune cells and biodistribution profile.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31306677	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306677	vaccine	5854206600849997966

2474	2474	13	PloS one	Is there more room to improve? The lifespan trajectory of procedural learning and its relationship to the between- and within-group differences in average response times.	Characterizing the developmental trajectories of cognitive functions such as learning, memory and decision making across the lifespan faces fundamental challenges. Cognitive functions typically encompass several processes that can be differentially affected by age. Methodological issues also arise when comparisons are made across age groups that differ in basic performance measures, such as in average response times (RTs). Here we focus on procedural learning-a fundamental cognitive function that underlies the acquisition of cognitive, social, and motor skills-and demonstrate how disentangling subprocesses of learning and controlling for differences in average RTs can reveal different developmental trajectories across the human lifespan. Two hundred-seventy participants aged between 7 and 85 years performed a probabilistic sequence learning task that enabled us to separately measure two processes of procedural learning, namely general skill learning and statistical learning. Using raw RT measures, in between-group comparisons, we found a U-shaped trajectory with children and older adults exhibiting greater general skill learning compared to adolescents and younger adults. However, when we controlled for differences in average RTs (either by using ratio scores or focusing on a subsample of participants with similar average speed), only children (but not older adults) demonstrated superior general skill learning consistently across analyses. Testing the relationship between average RTs and general skill learning within age groups shed light on further age-related differences, suggesting that general skill learning measures are more affected by average speed in some age groups. Consistent with previous studies of learning probabilistic regularities, statistical learning showed a gradual decline across the lifespan, and learning performance seemed to be independent of average speed, regardless of the age group. Overall, our results suggest that children are superior learners in various aspects of procedural learning, including both general skill and statistical learning. Our study also highlights the importance to test, and control for, the effect of average speed on other RT measures of cognitive functions, which can fundamentally affect the interpretation of group differences in developmental, aging and clinical psychology and neuroscience studies.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31314804	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314804	aging	-427385793606723821

First, the fluctuations of taurine and its transporters are associated with cognitive impairments in physiology and pathology. This may help diagnose and treat cognitive impairment though mechanisms are not fully uncovered in existing studies. Then, taurine supplements in cognitive impairment of different physiologies, pathologies and toxicologies have been demonstrated to significantly improve and restore cognition in most cases. However, elevated taurine level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by exogenous administration causes cognition retardations only in physiologically sensitive period between the perinatal to early postnatal period. In this review, taurine levels are summarized in different types of cognitive impairments. Subsequently, the effects of taurine supplements on cognitions in physiology, different pathologies and toxication of cognitive impairments (e.g. aging, Alzheimer' disease, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced brain damage, ischemia model, mental disorder, genetic diseases and cognitive injuries of pharmaceuticals and toxins) are analyzed. These data suggest that taurine can improve cognition function through multiple potential mechanisms (e.g. restoring functions of taurine transporters and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptors subunit; mitigating neuroinflammation; up-regulating Nrf2 expression and antioxidant capacities; activating Akt/CREB/PGC1α pathway, and further enhancing mitochondria biogenesis, synaptic function and reducing oxidative stress; increasing neurogenesis and synaptic function by pERK; activating PKA pathway). However, more mechanisms still need explorations.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31220527	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31220527	Alzheimer	5779887740609126631
2478	2478	344	DNA repair	Roles of OGG1 in transcriptional regulation and maintenance of metabolic homeostasis.	Cellular damage produced by conditions generating oxidative stress have far-reaching implications in human disease that encompass, but are not restricted to aging, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, airway inflammation/asthma, cancer, and metabolic syndrome including visceral obesity, insulin resistance, fatty liver disease, and dyslipidemia. Although there are numerous sources and cellular targets of oxidative stress, this review will highlight literature that has investigated downstream consequences of oxidatively-induced DNA damage in both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. The presence of such damage can in turn, directly and indirectly modulate cellular transcriptional and repair responses to such stressors. As such, the persistence of base damage can serve as a key regulator in coordinated gene-response cascades. Conversely, repair of these DNA lesions serves as both a suppressor of mutagenesis and by inference carcinogenesis, and as a signal for the cessation of ongoing oxidative stress. A key enzyme in all these processes is 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), which, via non-catalytic binding to oxidatively-induced DNA damage in promoter regions, serves as a nucleation site around which changes in large-scale regulation of inflammation-associated gene expression can occur. Further, the catalytic function of OGG1 can alter the three-dimensional structure of specialized DNA sequences, leading to changes in transcriptional profiles. This review will concentrate on adverse deleterious health effects that are associated with both the diminution of OGG1 activity via population-specific polymorphic variants and the complete loss of OGG1 in murine models. This mouse model displays diet- and age-related induction of metabolic syndrome, highlighting a key role for OGG1 in protecting against these phenotypes. Conversely, recent investigations using murine models having enhanced global expression of a mitochondrial-targeted OGG1 demonstrate that they are highly resistant to diet-induced disease. These data suggest strategies through which therapeutic interventions could be designed for reducing or limiting adverse human health consequences to these ubiquitous stressors.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31311771	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311771	stress	378386436485699053

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterised by unpredictable disease course and poor survival. After the introduction of novel antifibrotic drugs, the prognosis of patients with IPF is probably changing. FinnishIPF, a nationwide registry of carefully characterised patients, was initiated in Finland in 2011. For the data analysis, we included 453 incident IPF patients diagnosed during 2011-2015. In this study, we describe the demographics and prognosis of these real-life patients. The median overall survival time of registered IPF patients was 4.5 years. The transplant-free survival at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years was 95%, 83%, 70%, 58% and 45%, respectively. Smoking did not have any effect on survival. 117 (26%) patients received pirfenidone or nintedanib. Patients who received ≥6 months of treatment had better survival compared with those who did not receive treatment but this difference disappeared after age adjustment. The transplantation rate was 3%. Although IPF is diagnosed in Finland at a older age, the prognosis is better than expected due to a relatively well preserved lung function at diagnosis. Age and pulmonary function were identified as independent predictors of survival in the entire IPF patient population as well as in patients who had received antifibrotic treatment.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31304177	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304177	smoking	8946250624470221174
2486	2486	101	Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)	A DFT Study of the Modulation of the Antiaromatic and Open-Shell Character of Dibenzo[a,f]pentalene by Employing Three Strategies: Additional Benzoannulation, BN/CC Isosterism, and Substitution.	Dibenzo[a,f]pentalene ([a,f]DBP) is a highly antiaromatic molecule having appreciable open-shell singlet character in its ground state. In this work, DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory were performed to explore the efficiency of three strategies, that is, BN/CC isosterism, substitution, and (di)benzoannulation of [a,f]DBP, in controlling its electronic state and (anti)aromaticity. To evaluate the type and extent of the latter, the harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA) and aromatic fluctuation (FLU) indices were used, along with the nucleus-independent chemical shift NICS-XY-scan procedure. The results suggest that all three strategies could be employed to produce either the closed-shell system or open-shell species, which may be in the singlet or triplet ground state. Triplet states have been characterized as aromatic, which is in accordance with Baird's rule. All the singlet states were found to have weaker global paratropicity than [a,f]DBP. Additional (di)benzo fusion adds local aromatic subunit(s) and mainly retains the topology of the paratropic ring currents of the basic molecule. The substitution of two carbon atoms by the isoelectronic BN pair, or the introduction of substituents, results either in the same type and very similar topology of ring currents as in the parent compound, or leads to (anti)aromatic and nonaromatic subunits. The triplet states of all the examined compounds are also discussed.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31107568	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31107568	flu	363798057559041921

2490	2490	372	Cells	Targeting the Canonical WNT/β-Catenin Pathway in Cancer Treatment Using Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs.	Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress are common and co-substantial pathological processes accompanying and contributing to cancers. Numerous epidemiological studies have indicated that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could have a positive effect on both the prevention of cancer and tumor therapy. Numerous hypotheses have postulated that NSAIDs could slow tumor growth by acting on both chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. This review takes a closer look at these hypotheses. In the cancer process, one of the major signaling pathways involved is the WNT/β-catenin pathway, which appears to be upregulated. This pathway is closely associated with both chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in cancers. The administration of NSAIDs has been observed to help in the downregulation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway and thus in the control of tumor growth. NSAIDs act as PPARγ agonists. The WNT/β-catenin pathway and PPARγ act in opposing manners. PPARγ agonists can promote cell cycle arrest, cell differentiation, and apoptosis, and can reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, proliferation, invasion, and cell migration. In parallel, the dysregulation of circadian rhythms (CRs) contributes to cancer development through the upregulation of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway. By stimulating PPARγ expression, NSAIDs can control CRs through the regulation of many key circadian genes. The administration of NSAIDs in cancer treatment would thus appear to be an interesting therapeutic strategy, which acts through their role in regulating WNT/β-catenin pathway and PPARγ activity levels.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31311204	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311204	stress	-3040610224044779845

Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) due to cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) has long been recognized as a major source of morbidity and mortality. Early detection of cerebral vasospasm and identification of patients who are likely to become symptomatic is crucial to guide aggressive medical and/or endovascular interventions. Magnetic resonance imaging using arterial spin-label (ASL) is a noninvasive mean for assessing cerebral blood flow and is based on direct magnetic labeling of arterial blood water protons. The diagnostic role of ASL in acute ischemic stroke, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative disorders has been explained in multiple studies but its ability to predict vasospasm in aSAH has not been published before. The purpose of this study is to highlight the diagnostic implications of different perfusion patterns of ASL in patients with aSAH which can be utilized to prevent DCI in such patients when other commonly used modalities are not available, contraindicated, or fail to detect vasospasm.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31308864	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308864	stroke	-3258959365023720872

Two core features of depression are elevations in negative valence system (NVS) functioning and reductions in positive valence system (PVS) functioning. Existing psychological treatments have focused on the NVS and neglected the PVS, which may contribute to sub-optimal outcomes. The present mixed methods multiple randomised baseline case series preliminarily evaluates Augmented Depression Therapy (ADepT), a novel depression treatment targeting PVS and NVS disturbance, that aims both to reduce depression and enhance wellbeing. Eleven clinically depressed participants were recruited. Intensive time series analyses showed that 7/11 participants improved on both wellbeing and depression. Reliable and clinically significant improvement was observed for 9/11 participants on at least one of these outcomes (and also across a range of other PVS and NVS outcomes). Group level analyses showed significant pre to post change on all outcomes. Benchmarking analyses indicated these effect sizes were at least comparable (and for some PVS outcomes superior) to existing treatments. Gains were largely sustained over one-year follow-up. Qualitative interviews indicated ADepT was feasible and acceptable. These findings provide preliminary support for ADepT as a novel depression treatment. Further evaluation, directly comparing ADepT to existing treatments using randomised controlled trial designs, is now required.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31310929	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310929	depression	-5829979886567267504

"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes severe diarrhea in neonatal suckling piglets with a high mortality. Maternal vaccines that can induce lactogenic immunity to protect suckling piglets via colostrums and milk are pivotal for the prevention and control of PEDV infection in neonatal suckling piglets. In this study, a group of pregnant sows were first orally immunized with coated PEDV-loaded microspheres and boosted with killed PEDV vaccines (heterologous prime-boost). It has been detected that the levels of PEDV-specific antibodies (IgG and IgA) in their sera and milks were higher than other negative groups (p < 0.001 or p < 0.05). Furthermore, it has been proved by the neutralization assay that the induced antibodies could significantly inhibit virus infection as compared to other negative groups (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05). Importantly, after PEDV challenge, more than 90% of the suckling piglets delivered by the sows in the heterologous prime-boost group were completely protected.

M1 microglia contribute to the induction and development of various neuroinflammatory disorders, including stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease psychiatric disorders, neuropathic pain and epilepsy. Thus, inhibition of microglial activation would be crucial in treating neurological disorders. Recent studies suggest a number of attractive molecular targets for blocking microglial activation. Among them, the nicotinic ACh receptor (nAChR), which especially contains the α7 subunit, contributes to the regulation of microglial activity through the inhibition of the synthesis of proinflammatory molecules. In addition, the glutamate transporter GLAST expressed in microglia is upregulated by α7 nAChR stimulation, which is mediated through both inositol triphosphate-Ca	2019	eng	Review	 	31314410	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314410	stroke	-1452340812018195881

African Americans are at heightened risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), with biologic pathways poorly understood. We examined the role of allostatic load (AL) in the association of depressive symptoms with incident CHD among 2,670 African American men and women in the prospective Jackson Heart Study. Depressive symptoms were quantified using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Incident CHD was ascertained by self-report, death certificate survey, and adjudicated medical record surveillance. Baseline AL was quantified using biologic parameters of metabolic, cardiovascular, immune, and neuroendocrine subsystems and as a combined meta-factor. Sequential models adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral covariates, stratified to examine differences by sex. Greater depressive symptomatology was associated with greater metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune AL (p-values≤0.036) and AL meta-factor z-scores (p = 0.007), with findings driven by observations among females. Each 1-point increase in baseline depressive symptomatology, and 1-SD increase in metabolic AL, neuroendocrine AL, and AL meta-factor z-scores was associated with 3.3%, 88%, 39%, and 130% increases in CHD risk, respectively (p-values <0.001). Neuroendocrine AL and AL meta-factor scores predicted incident CHD among males but not females in stratified analyses. Metabolic AL partially mediated the association of depressive symptoms with incident CHD (5.79% mediation, p = 0.044), a finding present among females (p = 0.016) but not males (p = 0.840). Among African American adults, we present novel findings of an association between depressive symptomatology and incident CHD, partially mediated by metabolic AL. These findings appear to be unique to females, an important consideration in the design of targeted interventions for CHD prevention.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31307010	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307010	depression	1059874396577697902

There are established associations between advanced paternal age and offspring risk for psychiatric and developmental disorders. These are commonly attributed to genetic mutations, especially de novo single nucleotide variants (dnSNVs), that accumulate with increasing paternal age. However, the actual magnitude of risk from such mutations in the male germline is unknown. Quantifying this risk would clarify the clinical significance of delayed paternity. Using parent-child trio whole-exome-sequencing data, we estimate the relationship between paternal-age-related dnSNVs and risk for five disorders: autism spectrum disorder (ASD), congenital heart disease, neurodevelopmental disorders with epilepsy, intellectual disability and schizophrenia (SCZ). Using Danish registry data, we investigate whether epidemiologic associations between each disorder and older fatherhood are consistent with the estimated role of dnSNVs. We find that paternal-age-related dnSNVs confer a small amount of risk for these disorders. For ASD and SCZ, epidemiologic associations with delayed paternity reflect factors that may not increase with age.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31292440	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292440	heart+disease	2715453133655798791
2508	2508	222	Internal medicine journal	A Practical Management Approach to Gastroparesis.	Gastroparesis is a syndrome characterised by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Symptoms can include early satiety, abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, and regurgitation which cause significant morbidity in addition to nutritional deficits. There is a higher prevalence in diabetics and females, but the incidence in the Australian population has not been well studied. Management of gastroparesis involves investigating and correcting nutritional deficits, optimising glycaemic control, and improving gastrointestinal motility. Symptom control in gastroparesis can be challenging. Nutritional deficits should be addressed initially through dietary modification. Enteral feeding is a second line option when oral intake is insufficient. Home parenteral nutrition is rarely used, and only accessible through specialised clinics in the outpatient setting. Prokinetic medication classes that have been used include dopamine receptor antagonists, motilin receptor agonists, 5-HT	2019	eng	Review	Australia	31314176	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314176	diabetes	1992928170409443117

2510	2510	338	Clinical and experimental immunology	Islet-Immune Interactions in Type 1 Diabetes: The Nexus of Beta Cell Destruction.	Recent studies in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) support an emerging model of disease pathogenesis that involves intrinsic β-cell fragility combined with defects in both innate and adaptive immune cell regulation. This combination of defects induces systematic changes leading to organ-level atrophy and dysfunction of both the endocrine and exocrine portions of the pancreas, ultimately culminating in insulin deficiency and β-cell destruction. In this review, we discuss the animal model data and human tissue studies that have informed our current understanding of the cross-talk that occurs between β-cells, the resident stroma, and immune cells that potentiate T1D. Specifically, we will review the cellular and molecular signatures emerging from studies on tissues derived from organ procurement programs, focusing on in situ defects occurring within the T1D islet microenvironment, many of which are not yet detectable by standard peripheral blood biomarkers. In addition to improved access to organ donor tissues, various methodological advances, including immune receptor repertoire sequencing and single-cell molecular profiling, are poised to improve our understanding of antigen-specific autoimmunity during disease development. Collectively, the knowledge gains from these studies at the islet-immune interface are enhancing our understanding of T1D heterogeneity, likely to be an essential component for instructing future efforts to develop targeted interventions to restore immune tolerance and preserve β-cell mass and function.

2513	2513	136	Journal of psychiatric practice	Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) in Psychiatric Practice, Part 6: Pharmacodynamic Considerations.	This column is the sixth in a series exploring drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with a special emphasis on psychiatric medications. The first 3 columns in this DDI series discussed why patients being treated with psychiatric medications are at increased risk for taking multiple medications and thus experiencing DDIs, how to recognize such DDIs, strategies for avoiding and/or minimizing adverse outcomes from such DDIs, and pharmacokinetic considerations concerning DDIs in psychiatric practice. The fourth and fifth columns in this series presented a pair of parallel tables, one of which outlined the primary, known mechanism(s) of action of all commonly used psychiatric medications and one of which summarized major types of pharmacodynamic DDIs based on mechanism of action. Clinicians can use these 2 tables together to predict pharmacodynamically mediated DDIs. This sixth column in the series discusses some key issues related to pharmacodynamic interactions involving commonly used psychiatric medications. The column first discusses 3 types of pharmacological agents that deserve special mention because of the widespread types of pharmacodynamic DDIs they can have with psychiatric and other medications: ethanol, opioids, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, with a special focus on hypertensive crises and serotonin syndrome with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The column also discusses DDIs in terms of effects on the cardiovascular system, including QTc prolongation, blood pressure and heart rate regulation, increased risk of bleeding and abnormal bleeding, and valvular heart disease, and on the central nervous system, including increased sedation, respiratory depression, body temperature regulation, and tardive dyskinesia. The overall goal of this series of columns is to present a simple way of conceptualizing neuropsychiatric medications in terms of their pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics to allow prescribers to take these facts into consideration when they need to use more than 1 drug in combination to optimally treat a patient.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31291209	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291209	heart+disease	7506614456429888492
2514	2514	339	Environmental health and toxicology	Assessment of relationship between the use of household products and atopic dermatitis in Seoul: focused on products with associated risks.	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the use of certain household products (HPs) at home and atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults. The study was conducted on 1,500 households in Seoul, South Korea. We obtained information on general characteristics, the use of HPs, and AD through an online panel survey in July 2018. HPs were selected as 23 kinds of products with associated risks that are management targets of the Ministry of Environment. The international study of asthma and allergies in childhood was used for the AD questionnaires. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify AD affected by the use of HPs. Average number of used HPs was 13.44 out of 23, and average usage frequency of HPs was 3.52 times a month at home in Seoul for the last 1 year. Compared with subjects with a low number of HPs used (reference), subjects with a high number of used HPs (4th quartile) were more likely to have lifetime diagnosis of AD (odds ratio (OR) = 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI); 1.23-2.54), symptoms of AD in the last 12 months (OR = 2.66, 95% CI; 1.92-3.70), and treatment of AD in the last 12 months (OR = 2.37, 95% CI; 1.48-3.80). Compared with subjects with a low HPs usage frequency (reference), subjects with a high HPs usage frequency (4th quartile) were more likely to have lifetime diagnosis of AD (OR = 1.88, 95% CI; 1.31-2.70), symptoms of AD in the last 12 months (OR = 2.14, 95% CI; 1.54-2.96), and treatment of AD in the last 12 months (OR = 2.23, 95% CI; 1.39-3.60). Therefore, the use of HPs was significantly associated with AD. The findings of this study might be useful as basic data for managing allergic diseases and establishing preventive measures.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Korea (South)	31286750	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31286750	asthma	-3058031327323357308
2515	2515	11	Plant & cell physiology	Rice FLUORESCENT1 is involved in the Regulation of Chlorophyll.	Chlorophyll biosynthesis plays essential roles in photosynthesis and plant growth in response to environmental conditions. The accumulation of excess chlorophyll biosynthesis intermediates under light results in the production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. In this study, we identified a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, oxidation under photoperiod (oxp), that displayed photobleached lesions on its leaves, reduced growth, and decreased chlorophyll content during light/dark cycles or following a dark-to-light transition. The oxp mutant accumulated more chlorophyll precusors (5-aminolevulinic acid and protochlorophyllide) than the wild type in the dark, and more singlet oxygen following light exposure. Several singlet-oxygen-responsive genes were greatly upregulated in oxp, while the expression patterns of OsPORA and OsPORB, two genes encoding the chlorophyll biosynthesis enzyme NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase, were altered in de-etiolated oxp seedlings. Molecular and complementation studies revealed that oxp is a loss-of-function mutant in LOC_Os01g32730, a homolog of fluorescent (FLU) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Rice phytochrome-interacting factor-like14 (OsPIL14) transcription factor directly bound to the OsFLU1 promoter and activated its expression. Dark-grown transgenic rice seedlings overexpressing OsPIL14 accumulated more chlorophyll and turned green faster than the wild type upon light illumination. Thus, OsFLU1 is an important regulator of chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Japan	31290959	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31290959	flu	5901067357946111913

"The field of public health genomics has matured in the past two decades and is beginning to deliver genomic-based interventions for health and health care. In the past few years, the terms precision medicine and precision public health have been used to include information from multiple fields measuring biomarkers as well as environmental and other variables to provide tailored interventions. In the context of public health, ""precision"" implies delivering the right intervention to the right population at the right time, with the goal of improving health for all. In addition to genomics, precision public health can be driven by ""big data"" as identified by volume, variety, and variability in biomedical, sociodemographic, environmental, geographic, and other information. Most current big data applications in health are in elucidating pathobiology and tailored drug discovery. We explore how big data and predictive analytics can contribute to precision public health by improving public health surveillance and assessment, and efforts to promote uptake of evidence-based interventions, by including more extensive information related to place, person, and time. We use selected examples drawn from child health, cardiovascular disease, and cancer to illustrate the promises of precision public health, as well as current methodologic and analytic challenges to big data to fulfill these promises."	2019	eng	News	Switzerland	31315115	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315115	cancer	-7762049078455894395
2520	2520	480	Journal of viral hepatitis	Prevalence, mortality and healthcare utilization among Medicare beneficiaries with Hepatitis C in Hemodialysis units.	Hepatitis C (HCV) is more common among patients with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis compared to the general population. Thus we aimed to assess trends in prevalence, health resource utilization, and mortality amongst Medicare beneficiaries with HCV on hemodialysis. This is a retrospective study of outpatient and inpatient claims for Medicare beneficiaries receiving hemodialysis (2005-2016). A total of 291,663 subjects on hemodialysis were included (67.3±15.2 years, 55% male, 55% white, 49% age-based eligibility). The prevalence of HCV in subjects on hemodialysis was stable and was significantly higher (mean 4.2% in 2005-2016, p=0.50 for the trend) than in subjects not on hemodialysis (<1%). In multivariate analysis, liver cirrhosis (odds ratio=3.4 (95% CI=3.3-3.6)) was an independent predictor of 1-year mortality among hemodialysis patients. Mean total inpatient payments in dialysis patients with HCV remained stable during 2005 ($73,803) through 2016 ($72,133) (trend p=0.54) while mean total outpatient payment decreased from 2005 ($53,497) to 2016 ($35,439; trend p=0.0013). In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for age, gender, race, and location, both HCV and cirrhosis remained significant contributors to greater spending [HCV: inpatient +22.1%(+19.2%-25%), HCV: outpatient +18.4%(+14.6%-22.2%), cirrhosis: inpatient +59.7%(+56.9%-62.6%), cirrhosis: outpatient +9.4%(+6.2%-12.6%)]. In conclusion, HCV-infected Medicare patients receiving hemodialysis incur greater resource utilization; mortality is higher in patients with cirrhosis only. Although HCV prevalence in Medicare hemodialysis recipients is higher than in patients without hemodialysis, these rates are lower than reported, suggesting potential under-screening for HCV in this high-risk population.

ROS1 gene rearrangements exist in 1-2% of non-small cell lung cancers, typically occurring in younger, never or light smokers with adenocarcinoma. ROS1 gene fusions are potent oncogenic drivers, the presence of which results in the susceptibility of tumours to ROS1-targeted therapy. Crizotinib was the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor to demonstrate activity in ROS1-rearranged lung cancer, and remains the recommended first-line therapy for patients with advanced ROS1-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer. Despite excellent initial responses to crizotinib, the majority of patients develop disease progression, which may be intracranial or extracranial. Identification of resistance mechanisms to crizotinib, and newer generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors with increased potency against ROS1 and ROS1-resistance mutations, and improved intracranial activity are under evaluation in clinical trials. In this review, we discuss ROS1 rearrangements in non-small cell lung cancer, and provide an update on targeting ROS1-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer with crizotinib and newer generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors.	2019	eng	Journal Article	New Zealand	31313100	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313100	cancer	-3248233692182971167
2522	2522	556	Medicine	Factors affecting the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding in acute ischemic stroke patients.	Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a common complication that occurs after stroke, and GIB may negatively affect patient prognosis. In this study, we aimed to examine:(1) the risk factors of GIB in acute cerebral infarction patients;(2) association between GIB and 1-year mortality in patients with acute cerebral infarction.Patients with acute cerebral infarction were divided into 2 groups based on the occurrence of GIB during acute stroke stage. Patient characteristics, clinical presentation, stroke risk factors, comorbidities, laboratory data, medication, and outcomes were investigated to analyze the associations between the variables and the probability of having GIB. In addition, patients in the study were matched individually by age, gender. A 1:1 matched case-control method and conditional logistic regression models for single and multiple factors were used to assess the risk factors of GIB in acute cerebral infarction patients.Clinical data of patients with acute cerebral infarction were reviewed and analyzed during the years 2015 and 2016. Finally, 1662 patients with acute cerebral infarction were included in this study, of whom 139 (8.5%) patients had GIB at admission. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the independent risk factors for GIB in patients with acute cerebral infarction were advanced age (OR = 1.030, P = .009), low Glasgow Coma Scale (GSC) score (OR = 0.850, P = .014), infection (OR = 4.693, P < .001), high NIHSS score (OR = 1.114, P = .001), and posterior circulation infarction (OR = 4.981, P = .010). The case-control study ultimately included 136 case-control pairs. Stepwise conditional regression analyses revealed that the independent risk factors for GIB in patients with acute cerebral infarction were low Glasgow Coma Scale (GSC) score (RR = 0.645, P = .011), infection (RR = 15.326, P = .001), and posterior circulation infarction (RR = 6.129, P = .045). The group with GIB had a higher rate of mortality and disability level (mRS grade ≥ 4) than the group without GIB (P < .001) within 1 year after stroke. In addition, independent risk factors of death within 1 year after stroke in patients were GIB (OR = 6.096, P < .001), infection (OR = 4.493, P < .001), mRS grade ≥ 4 (OR = 4.129, P < .001), and coronary heart disease (OR = 3.718, P = .001).GIB is a common complication after ischemic stroke. These identified factors may help clinicians identify risks of GIB before it develops. GIB is associated with increased risk of 1-year mortality and poor functional outcome in acute cerebral infarction patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31305417	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305417	stroke	-8278375716950339547

We retrospectively analyzed serum IgM antibodies (Abs) to influenza viruses from two tertiary hospitals in Beijing from December 2016 to February 2018. Samples from 36,792 patients, aged 0-98 years, were collected and tested. Among the patients, 923 children from two winter flu seasons were assayed with both antigens and IgM Abs to Flu A and Flu B and assigned as paired groups. Another 2,340 adults and 1,978 children with only antigen tested in the 2016 and 2017 winter flu seasons were named as unpaired groups. IgM Abs-positivity rates in children were 0.80% and 36.57% for Flu A and Flu B, respectively, peaking at 4-5 years of age. For adults, the Flu A and Flu B IgM Abs-positivity rates were 10.34% and 21.49%, respectively, peaking at 18-35 years of age. The trend of temporal distribution between the children and the adults was significantly correlated for IgM Abs to Flu B, but not for Flu A. Compared with unpaired groups, the detection rate of Flu A antigen was significantly higher than IgM Abs in children, whereas frequencies of IgM Abs were higher than antigen in adults. Incidence of Flu B antigen was sharply increased in 2017 winter than in the 2016 winter in both children and adults, but no concomitant increase was observed in IgM Abs to Flu B. For paired children groups, incidence of Flu B antigen in the 2017 flu season was significantly higher than that in the 2016 flu season; in contrast, positive rates of IgM Abs in the 2017 flu season were even lower than those in 2016. Considering antigen detection may reflect the Flu A/Flu B epidemic, our results indicate single-assayed IgM Abs were less effective in the diagnosis of acute influenza virus infection, and the use of this assay for epidemiology evaluations was not supported by these findings.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31009494	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009494	flu	6800965548226529308

Part A : the journal of the International Society for Analytical Cytology	Nanoliposomes Co-Encapsulating Photoswitchable Probe and Photosensitizer for Super-Resolution Optical Imaging and Photodynamic Therapy.	Photosensitizers (PSs) are ideal cancer theranostic drugs that can be administered as both fluorescence imaging reagents and photodynamic therapy (PDT) drugs. To improve the tumoritropic behavior of PSs, nanoliposomes are presently being considered as optimal PSs carriers. Although nanoliposomal PSs have been utilized in clinical therapy, PSs localization and photosensitive processing in nanoliposomal PSs are rarely observed on nanoscale. Investigating changes in the fine structure of nanoliposomes under photosensitive processing will further our understanding of the photosensitive effect on nanoliposomal PSs. In this study, nanoliposomes co-encapsulating the PSs benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid A (BPD) and the photoswitchable probe Cy5-927 were prepared to realize PDT and nanoscale super-resolution optical imaging. The fine structures of nanoliposomal BPD and Cy5-927 (LBC) were visualized by a home-built stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). Our PDT results showed that the photorelease and PDT efficiency of BPD were not decreased by co-encapsulating with Cy5-927 in LBC. Taken together, LBC can be used as a new optical probe and PDT reagent for investigating changes in nanoliposomes fine structure and micro-interaction in the cellular process of PDT. Therefore, our results deepened our understanding of liposome-based PDT for optimizing cancer treatment. © 2019 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313510	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313510	cancer	-8680242653057858999

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare non-infectious neutrophilic dermatosis often unknowed. It usually presents with inflammatory skin ulcer, very painful, with rapid evolution. It is commonly found in a context of malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatic and/or haematological disease. Its diagnosis is very often late after multiple therapeutic failures. We report a case of pyoderma gangrenosum whose diagnosis was not obvious. A patient was admitted to our department for a persistent dermatological lesion and adverse evolution despite debridements and the administration of antibiotics. He was followed for prostate cancer, high blood pressure and asthma. Due to observed biological abnormalities such as neutrophil leukocytosis with myelocyte and metamyelocyte myeloma, without blood blastosis and normochromic normocytic anemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia was suspected. It was later overturned by the various inconclusive supplementary examinations. This is how the diagnosis of PG was evoked and confirmed by anatomopathological examination showing a histopathological appearance of granulation tissue consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum and no sign of malignancy. The institution of a corticotherapy treatment resulted in the cure.	2019	fre	English Abstract	Uganda	31312310	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312310	asthma	-713893030279048092

After excluding human immunodeficiency virus, lower respiratory infections, malaria, diarrheal diseases, and tuberculosis, cervical cancer kills more women than any other form of illness in the country. Unfortunately, Tanzania has a low doctor-to-patient ratio (1:50,000) and nearly 7000 women die each year from this disease. The clinical problem is further magnified by the country's lack of resources and prevailing poverty, sporadic cervical cancer screening, prevalence of high-risk oncogenic human papillomavirus subtypes, and relatively high rates of human immunodeficiency virus co-infection. In recent years, addressing the cervical cancer problem has become a priority for the Tanzanian government. In this systematic review of 39 peer-reviewed publications that appeared in the PubMed/MEDLINE (NCBI) database from 2013 to 2018, we synthesize the growing body of literature to capture current trends in Tanzania's evolving cervical cancer landscape. Six domains were identified, including risk factors, primary prevention, barriers to screening, treatment, healthcare worker education, and sustainability. In addition to traditional risk factors associated with sexual behavior, acetowhite changes observed during visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid, lower education, rural setting, and HIV positivity also have a noteworthy clinical impact.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31309135	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309135	HIV	-2139739377293212491

Objective Ascites becomes refractory to diuretics in cirrhotic patients, who then require repeated large-volume paracentesis or cell-free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy (CART). The objective of this study was to confirm the safety and efficacy of CART, evaluate the actual situations with respect to the prescription of diuretics and determine the role of diuretics after the introduction of CART. Patients and Methods We recruited 34 cirrhotic patients who received CART with concomitant diuretics using furosemide (76.2%), spironolactone (48.5%), thiazide (4.0%) and tolvaptan (53.5%) from a post-marketing surveillance of CART. Results CART improved the tested clinical indices, i.e. body weight, abdominal circumference, performance status, dietary intake, total protein and albumin. The intervals of CART sessions were significantly prolonged in patients who received tolvaptan (mean, 22.5 days) compared to those not receiving tolvaptan (mean, 10.8 days) (p<0.001). The drop-out rate was significantly decreased in patients receiving tolvaptan compared to those not receiving tolvaptan when drop-out was defined as paracentesis (p<0.05). Conclusion We confirmed that CART is an effective treatment for refractory ascites occurring in cirrhotic patients. The administration of tolvaptan in combination with CART leads to a significantly reduced rate of ascites accumulation.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Japan	31292400	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292400	Cirrhosis	4859179221363512189

Mirror movements occur in early childhood due to the maturation of the corpus callosum of noncrossing motor pathways. Such movements are considered normal until the age of 10 and are rarely reported in children older than 10 years. Mirror movements are involuntary movements that occur in the homologous contralateral extremity on voluntary activation. Permanent mirror movements can occur with anomalies; however, also are reported familial and sporadic cases. Migraine is the most common primary headache in childhood. Its prevalence ranges from 1% to 3% between the ages of 3 and 7, and from 8% to 23% in the adolescence. The prevalence of migraine in adolescent girls is higher. For the migraine diagnosis, the imaging studies are unnecessary, and a detailed history and physical examination are sufficient. In this study, we present a case of a 17-year-old girl with mirror movements accompanied by migraine.	2019	eng	Case Reports	Turkey	31297488	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297488	headache	6195056361889291497

2547	2547	166	Ecotoxicology and environmental safety	Effects of dissolved humic acid on fluoroquinolones sorption and retention to kaolinite.	Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are widely used in human and veterinary medicaments, and as such are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is widely distributed in natural water and sediment and dissolved humic acid (DHA) is a major component of DOM. The coexistence of DHA might influence the sorption, migration and transformation of FQs, thus determining their environmental fate. In this study, the interaction of DHA and ofloxacin (OFL)/flumequine (FLU) was evaluated using dialysis-bag assays. The sorption of OFL and FLU to kaolinite in the presence of DHA under different pH conditions was investigated. The results revealed that the binding affinities of FQs to DHA were weakened with increasing pH from 4.0 to 10.0 due to the increased negative charge of DHA and subsequent electrostatic repulsion. Sorption experiments indicated that co-precipitation was an important mechanism for OFL/FLU removal from the aqueous phase under acidic conditions. At pH 7.0, the affinity of OFL-DHA/FLU-DHA to kaolinite was weaker than that of OFL/FLU thus suppressed its sorption. At pH 9.5, the affinity of OFL-DHA to kaolinite was stronger than that of OFL and consequently promoted its sorption, but there was no observed effect of DHA on FLU sorption. During desorption, DHA could bind to OFL/FLU and promote its desorption from kaolinite at neutral pH. In binary solute systems of OFL and FLU, OFL was a more effective competitor for the sorption sites of kaolinite than FLU.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	30991246	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30991246	flu	3058137260516373249

2549	2549	143	Current biology : CB	Loss of Function of Phosphodiesterase 11A4 Shows that Recent and Remote Long-Term Memories Can Be Uncoupled.	Systems consolidation is a process by which memories initially require the hippocampus for recent long-term memory (LTM) but then become increasingly independent of the hippocampus and more dependent on the cortex for remote LTM. Here, we study the role of phosphodiesterase 11A4 (PDE11A4) in systems consolidation. PDE11A4, which degrades cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), is preferentially expressed in neurons of CA1, the subiculum, and the adjacently connected amygdalohippocampal region. In male and female mice, deletion of PDE11A enhances remote LTM for social odor recognition and social transmission of food preference (STFP) despite eliminating or silencing recent LTM for those same social events. Measurement of a surrogate marker of neuronal activation (i.e., Arc mRNA) suggests the recent LTM deficits observed in Pde11 knockout mice correspond with decreased activation of ventral CA1 relative to wild-type littermates. In contrast, the enhanced remote LTM observed in Pde11a knockout mice corresponds with increased activation and altered functional connectivity of anterior cingulate cortex, frontal association cortex, parasubiculum, and the superficial layer of medial entorhinal cortex. The apparent increased neural activation observed in prefrontal cortex of Pde11a knockout mice during remote LTM retrieval may be related to an upregulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits NR1 and NR2A. Viral restoration of PDE11A4 to vCA1 alone is sufficient to rescue both the LTM phenotypes and upregulation of NR1 exhibited by Pde11a knockout mice. Together, our findings suggest remote LTM can be decoupled from recent LTM, which may have relevance for cognitive deficits associated with aging, temporal lobe epilepsy, or transient global amnesia.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31303492	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303492	aging	-3060116862184714437

Preeclampsia is a common disease in pregnant women that can only be diagnosed from 20 weeks after fertilization. Developing early diagnosis markers is urgent and would be helpful in selecting appropriate treatment strategies. The present study aimed to identify the differential expression profiles of microRNAs in the plasma between patients with preeclampsia and normal pregnancies using microarray methods. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), the differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) identified from the microarray analysis were validated. A total of 3 miRNAs, including hsa-miR-1304-5p, hsa-miR-320a and hsa-miR-5002-5p, were upregulated in the plasma of patients with preeclampsia pregnancies. Examination of the functions of these miRNAs demonstrated that they were involved in cell proliferation, indicating that preeclampsia affected this pathway. In addition, 26 downregulated miRNAs were identified by microarray methods. The functions of these miRNAs included immune regulation, vascular development, cancer pathology and pathology of other disease (tuberculosis, oligozoospermia, psoriasis and Alzheimer's disease). Using qPCR, the most differentially expressed miRNAs were confirmed to be hsa-miR-1304-5p, hsa-miR-320a and hsa-miR-5002-5p, which were upregulated, as well as hsa-miR-188-3p, hsa-miR-211-5p, hiv1-miR-TAR-3p, hsa-miR-4432 and hsa-miR-4498 that were significantly downregulated in the plasma of preeclampsia patients.

Secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) exposure contributes to ill health and disease, including heart disease, lung cancer, and stroke (1). Although cigarette smoking has declined among U.S. workers, workplace exposure to SHS remains high, particularly among workers in certain industries, such as construction (2,3). Implementation of smoke-free laws has proven to be beneficial in reducing SHS exposure in general (1). CDC analyzed data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Occupational Health Supplement to assess the prevalence of self-reported workplace SHS exposure among nonsmoking workers by smoke-free policy status in the workers' states of residence and in detailed industry categories and subcategories. In 2015, 19.9% of nonsmoking workers reported any exposure to SHS at work during the 12 months preceding the interview, and 10.1% reported frequent exposure (twice a week or more). Nonsmoking workers who resided in states with comprehensive smoke-free laws in all three categories of venues (private worksites, bars, and restaurants) were least likely to report frequent exposure to workplace SHS. Nonsmoking workers employed in the commercial and industrial machinery and equipment repair and maintenance industry reported the highest prevalences of any workplace SHS exposure (65.1%), whereas the construction industry had the highest reported number of exposed workers (2.9 million); these industry categories/subcategories include outdoor workplaces and other settings that are unlikely to be protected by smoke-free laws. Identifying specific at-risk workplaces and implementing targeted intervention strategies could help reduce SHS exposure at work and protect workers' health.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31295233	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295233	smoking	2642993575444549134

A positive association between Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure and coronary heart disease has been shown, but not in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). During the treatment of drinking water, chlorination leads to the formation of chlorinated derivatives of Bisphenol A (ClxBPA), that have higher estrogenic activity than BPA. No evidence exists for a relationship between exposure to ClxBPA and myocardial infarction in patients with T2D. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between exposure to BPA, ClxBPA and the occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with T2D. Two nested case-control studies in two independent European cohorts were performed. Each case with incident MI during follow-up was matched to one control on age, sex and personal cardiovascular history in the same cohort. Association between baseline urine concentrations of BPA and of ClxBPA and incident MI was determined. Exposure to BPA was 31% in the ESTHER cohort and 18% in the SURDIAGENE cohort. In a meta-analysis of the two studies, occurrence of MI was significantly associated with urine BPA detection: adjusted OR=1.97 (1.05; 3.70), p=0.04. Exposure to ClxBPA significantly differed in the SURDIAGENE and ESTHER studies: 24% and 8%, respectively (p=0.0003). It was very strongly associated with MI in the SURDIAGENE cohort with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 14.15 (95% confidence interval: 2.77 - 72.40) but this association was not replicated in the ESTHER study: adjusted OR: 0.17 (0.02 to 1.23). Whether these results may be explained by different water chlorination processes in France and Germany, resulting in different ClxBPA exposure levels, requires further investigation.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31310111	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310111	diabetes	4700641534148321049

The appropriate surgical treatment for inguinal hernia in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites remains controversial. A 79-year-old male undergoing treatment for Child-Pugh B hepatitis C-induced liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma complicated with bilateral inguinal hernia underwent transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair. During surgery, barbed sutures were used to facilitate appropriate peritoneal closure. His postoperative course was uneventful. Information on TAPP repair for inguinal hernia in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites is limited. The International Guidelines for Inguinal Hernia Management recommend Lichtenstein repair for patients with ascites. TAPP repair requires peritonectomy via a posterior endoscopic approach; therefore, proper peritoneal closure is important to prevent the leakage of ascitic fluid. Herein, TAPP repair was safely and successfully completed using barbed sutures to achieve proper and strong peritoneal closure. TAPP repair using barbed sutures can be an effective treatment option for patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites.	2019	eng	Case Reports	England	31275552	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31275552	Cirrhosis	-1525688508571111688

Numerous dietary, genetic, and pharmacological studies now point to links between metabolism and growth regulation as a central aspect in determining longevity and, perhaps more importantly, health with advancing age. Here, we focus on a relatively new player in aging studies GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase, a key factor in growth and metabolism whose name fails to convey the extensive breadth of its role in cellular adaptation. First, we provide a brief overview of GSK3, touching on those aspects that are likely relevant to aging. Then, we outline the role of GSK3 in cellular functions including growth signaling, cell fate, and metabolism. Next, we describe evidence demonstrating a direct role for GSK3 in a range of age-related diseases, despite the fact that they differ considerably in their etiology and pathology. Finally, we discuss the role that GSK3 may play in normative aging and how GSK3 might be a suitable target to oppose age-related disease vulnerability.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31313216	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313216	aging	6892866957050839435

And within that state, the 38 counties comprising South Texas--a highly populated, largely Hispanic area characterized by high uninsured rates and low numbers of health care providers--are emblematic of nationwide crises in public health. The South Texas Health Status Review: A Health Disparities Roadmap brings health care disparities to light in instructive detail. Over thirty key health conditions and risk factors, such as breast cancer, diabetes, obesity, tuberculosis, smoking and alcohol use, lead exposure, birth defects, and homicide rates, are analyzed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and location (urban or rural), and the results compared with the rest of Texas and the nation as a whole. A section on conclusions and recommendations outlines factors contributing to these conditions and offers suggestions for improvement. These important data should stimulate further population studies and provide impetus for targeted public health interventions and community outreach programs to reduce health inequities and advance care access in the state and the U.S. at large. Major health issues covered in the report include: • Communicable diseases • Cancer incidence and mortality • Maternal and child health • Chronic diseases • Behavioral risk factors in adults • Environmental health issues • Suicide, homicide, and vehicular mortality. The South Texas Health Status Review contains valuable lessons for researchers in health promotion and health disparities, as well as community health professionals. Policymakers involved in reducing health disparities will find it especially useful.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314218	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314218	diabetes	7926736692763443624

The rising prevalence of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) could threaten gains made in combating the HIV epidemic and compromise the 90-90-90 target proposed by United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) to have achieved virological suppression in 90% of all persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) by the year 2020. HIVDR has implications for the persistence of HIV, the selection of current and future ART drug regimens, and strategies of vaccine and cure development. Focusing on drug classes that are in clinical use, this Review critically summarizes what is known about the mechanisms the virus utilizes to escape drug control. Armed with this knowledge, strategies to limit the expansion of HIVDR are proposed.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31295424	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295424	vaccine	2531450382701518075

2574	2574	115	Aging cell	Hsp90β interacts with MDM2 to suppress p53-dependent senescence during skeletal muscle regeneration.	Cellular senescence plays both beneficial and detrimental roles in embryonic development and tissue regeneration, while the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Recent studies disclosed the emerging roles of heat-shock proteins in regulating muscle regeneration and homeostasis. Here, we found that Hsp90β, but not Hsp90α isoform, was significantly upregulated during muscle regeneration. RNA-seq analysis disclosed a transcriptional elevation of p21 in Hsp90β-depleted myoblasts, which is due to the upregulation of p53. Moreover, knockdown of Hsp90β in myoblasts resulted in p53-dependent cellular senescence. In contrast to the notion that Hsp90 interacts with and protects mutant p53 in cancer, Hsp90β preferentially bound to wild-type p53 and modulated its degradation via a proteasome-dependent manner. Moreover, Hsp90β interacted with MDM2, the chief E3 ligase of p53, to regulate the stability of p53. In line with these in vitro studies, the expression level of p53-p21 axis was negatively correlated with Hsp90β in aged mice muscle. Consistently, administration of 17-AAG, a Hsp90 inhibitor under clinical trial, impaired muscle regeneration by enhancing injury-induced senescence in vivo. Taken together, our finding revealed a previously unappreciated role of Hsp90β in regulating p53 stability to suppress senescence both in vitro and in vivo.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31313490	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313490	cancer	-6119620726358216329

Congenital tuberculosis (TB) is difficult to detect because the disease presents few or no symptoms in the fetus during pregnancy and nonspecific symptoms in neonates. We reviewed 20 cases of congenital TB reported between 2011 and 2017 and report a case of a mother and her 8 days old neonate with congenital TB. In these 21 cases (including our case), the most common clinical presentations were respiratory distress, fever, and hepatosplenomegaly. The most common chest imaging findings were pneumonia, multiple pulmonary nodules, and miliary pattern. The mortality rate of infants with TB was increased ~2.2-fold if their mothers had no symptoms. The case reported herein concerns an 8 days old neonate with the rare presentation of a 2 days history of fever, followed by abdominal distension without respiratory symptoms. Computed tomography (CT) imaging exhibited a large amount of right pleural effusion. Multiple antimicrobial therapies were administered to the neonate; however, his symptoms persisted. Repeat CT was used to identify a progressed disease with multiple nodules over the lung, spleen, and hepatic hilar region. Standard anti-TB medications were prescribed, and the patient recovered gradually. Both gastric lavage and pleural effusion cultures confirmed the diagnosis of TB. The neonate's mother denied any TB contact history and the diagnosis of any medical disease during pregnancy, but she experienced a fulminant course of miliary TB and was admitted to the intensive care unit 24 days postpartum. She died despite receiving anti-TB treatment. In TB-endemic areas, congenital TB should be taken into consideration when neonates develop fever, respond poorly to antimicrobial treatment, and when their mothers deny any TB contact history.	2019	eng	Case Reports	Switzerland	31294005	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31294005	tuberculosis	-4163754746025598258

Ultrasound elastography has become a promising noninvasive approach for assessing liver fibrosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnosis ability of liver stiffness detected by shear wave elastography (SWE) for predicting the presence of esophageal varices (EVs) in cirrhotic patients. Four hundred sixty-eight cirrhotic patients were enrolled consecutively. Liver stiffness and EVs were detected by SWE and endoscopy, respectively. The baseline characteristics were recorded, and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) were used to compare the diagnosis accuracy. Multivariate analysis was used to identify the risk factors for EVs in cirrhosis. The mean liver stiffness was 18.4 kPa with a range of 6.8 to 52.5 kPa. Two hundred seventy-one patients had no EVs (57.9%), 139 patients had F1 EVs (29.7%), and 58 patients had high-risk EVs (12.4%). The optimal cutoff values of SWE for predicting EVs and high-risk varices were 18.5 and 20.4 kPa, respectively. The AUROCs for predicting the incidence of EVs were 0.792 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.884-0.842), 0.814 (95% CI, 0.658-0.875), and 0.895 (95% CI, 0.813-0.918) for platelet, platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio, and liver stiffness, respectively. For predicting the presence of high-risk varices, liver stiffness again had the highest AUROC. Multivariate analysis identified liver stiffness and platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio as independent predictive factors for EVs in cirrhosis. Liver stiffness measured by SWE is an effective diagnostic tool for predicting EVs with greater accuracy, and SWE value is an independent factor for predicting high-risk EVs.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31299039	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299039	Cirrhosis	-3267081294086663175

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has rapidly become the most common form of chronic liver disease in children and adolescents. Over the past 5 years, developments have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic factors, natural history, diagnostic modalities and therapeutic targets for this disease. New polymorphisms, such as those in PNPLA3, TM6SF2, MBOAT7 and GCKR, have been identified and used to predict the development and severity of NAFLD in both adults and children, and their interaction with environmental factors has been elucidated. Studies have demonstrated the true burden of paediatric NAFLD and its progression to end-stage liver disease in adulthood. In particular, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis can progress to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis. Non-invasive imaging tests, such as transient elastography, will probably replace liver biopsy for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and the assessment of fibrosis severity in the near future. The therapeutic landscape is also expanding rapidly with the development of drugs that can modify liver steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, indicating that pharmacotherapy for NAFLD will become available in the future. In this Review, we summarize current knowledge and new advances related to the pathogenesis and management of paediatric NAFLD.	2019	eng	Review	England	31278377	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31278377	Cirrhosis	2441555519716118559

2593	2593	413	Translational behavioral medicine	Care-paradigm shift promoting smoking cessation treatment among cancer center patients via a low-burden strategy, Electronic Health Record-Enabled Evidence-Based Smoking Cessation Treatment.	Tobacco smoking is an important risk factor for cancer incidence, an effect modifier for cancer treatment, and a negative prognostic factor for disease outcomes. Inadequate implementation of evidence-based smoking cessation treatment in cancer centers, a consequence of numerous patient-, provider-, and system-level barriers, contributes to tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. This study provides data for a paradigm shift from a frequently used specialist referral model to a point-of-care treatment model for tobacco use assessment and cessation treatment for outpatients at a large cancer center. The point-of-care model is enabled by a low-burden strategy, the Electronic Health Record-Enabled Evidence-Based Smoking Cessation Treatment program, which was implemented in the cancer center clinics on June 2, 2018. Five-month pre- and post-implementation data from the electronic health record (EHR) were analyzed. The percentage of cancer patients assessed for tobacco use significantly increased from 48% to 90% (z = 126.57, p < .001), the percentage of smokers referred for cessation counseling increased from 0.72% to 1.91% (z = 3.81, p < .001), and the percentage of smokers with cessation medication significantly increased from 3% to 17% (z = 17.20, p < .001). EHR functionalities may significantly address barriers to point-of-care treatment delivery, improving its consistent implementation and thereby increasing access to and quality of smoking cessation care for cancer center patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31313808	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313808	smoking	5847042211895226591

Seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) is a plant with economic and ecological value. It is uniquely capable of growing well under salt and drought stress. WRKY transcription factors play important roles in the ability of plants to resist stress. In this study, 48 HrWRKY genes were identified based on RNA sequencing of H. rhamnoides. Evaluation of expression pattern of HrWRKY 1, HrWRKY 17, HrWRKY 18, HrWRKY 21, HrWRKY 33-2, HrWRKY 40-2, HrWRKY 41 and HrWRKY 71 suggested that they were involved in abiotic stress. Interestingly, HrWRKY 21, one of eight HrWRKY genes, was a positive regulator of abiotic stress tolerance in H. rhamnoides. In addition, most morphological attributes of roots in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum lines (overexpressing HrWRKY 21) were also markedly increased compared with the wild-type (WT), including total lengths, specific root lengths and surface areas. Stress tolerance of transgenic lines was also correlated with higher antioxidant activity (SOD and POD), lower percentage of relative conductivity (REC) and lower activity of malondialdehyde (MDA) under stress conditions. These findings represent a foundation of knowledge about the molecular mechanisms driving resistance to adverse conditions in plants; they are a promising step towards development of tree cultivars with improved tolerance to abiotic stress.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Canada	31315001	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315001	stress	6669026579073415958

We present a case of a man with headache and progressive behavioural disturbance. His cognitive decline progressed over a few months such that he was unable to hold a conversation or carry out any daily tasks such as washing and dressing. He had some upper motor neurone signs in his limbs and features of brainstem dysfunction including dysarthria and ocular abnormalities. His brain magnetic resonance imaging showed signs of brain 'sagging'. He was thought to have frontotemporal brain sagging syndrome. Prior to any treatment, he began to improve. Over the course of a week he became markedly better, was back to normal within 3 months and remains so 7 months later. We propose that resolution of spontaneous intracranial hypotension led to resolution of frontotemporal brain sagging syndrome. We believe this is the first case described where this has occurred without any intervention. It is important to recognise this condition as a potentially reversible cause of dementia.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31308118	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308118	headache	7202701636941380671
2604	2604	44	Blood	TNF-alpha driven inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction define the platelet hyperreactivity of aging.	Aging and chronic inflammation are independent risk factors for the development of atherothrombosis and cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that aging-associated inflammation promotes the development of platelet hyperreactivity and increases thrombotic risk during aging. Functional platelet studies in aged-frail adults and old mice demonstrated that their platelets are hyperreactive and form larger thrombi. We identified TNF- as the key aging-associated proinflammatory cytokine responsible for platelet hyperreactivity. We further showed that platelet hyperreactivity is neutralized by abrogating signaling through TNF- receptors in vivo in a mouse model of aging. Analysis of the bone marrow compartments showed significant platelet-biased hematopoiesis in old mice reflected by increased megakaryocyte-committed progenitor cells, megakaryocyte ploidy status and thrombocytosis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of native mouse megakaryocytes showed significant reprogramming of inflammatory, metabolic and mitochondrial gene pathways in old mice that appeared to play a significant role in determining platelet hyperreactivity. Platelets from old mice (where TNF- was endogenously increased), and from young mice exposed to exogenous TNF- exhibited significant mitochondrial changes characterized by elevated mitochondrial mass and increased oxygen consumption during activation. These mitochondrial changes were mitigated upon TNF- blockade. Similar increases in platelet mitochondrial mass were seen in platelets from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, where TNF- levels are also increased. Furthermore, metabolomics studies of platelets from young and old mice demonstrated age-dependent metabolic profiles that may differentially poise platelets for activation. Altogether, we present previously-unrecognized evidence that TNF- critically regulates megakaryocytes resident in the bone marrow niche and aging-associated platelet hyperreactivity and thrombosis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31311815	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311815	aging	2543311963908571128

Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a diarrheal disease of swine caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). It is characterized by acute watery diarrhea, dehydration and vomiting in swine of all ages and is especially fatal for neonatal and postweaning piglets. The spike protein of PEDV plays an important role in mediating virus attachment and fusion to target cells, and recent studies also reported that the neutralizing epitopes of the spike protein were mainly located in the S1 subunit, which makes it a candidate for vaccine development and clinical diagnosis.

Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy, and relapse after initial treatment is frequently fatal. Although ovarian cancer typically has an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, a strong intratumoral T cell presence is associated with an improved response to chemotherapy and better overall prognosis. Given the success of checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of other malignancies, there has been an attempt to replicate these results in ovarian cancer clinical trials. Preclincal studies in ovarian cancer have also been conducted over the past decade, and most of the focus has been on the use of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Several other checkpoint inhibitors have also been investigated in various combinations with chemotherapy, oncolytic vaccines, co-stimulatory molecules, poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, and other checkpoint inhibitors. Unfortunately, these successes have yet to translate to the clinical realm. Whether this is because the drug class is truly ineffective in ovarian cancer, or simply because the research is lacking is unclear. Either way, it is evident that preclinical data on the use of checkpoint inhibitors is woefully deficient in ovarian cancer and more research is urgently needed to inform the translation of immune checkpoint blockade into successful clinical use. In this review, we discuss the results from preclinical studies using checkpoint inhibitors to treat ovarian cancer, with a focus on strategies that show potential for clinical use.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31312712	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312712	cancer	1642787330067525131

Clinical studies have demonstrated that cigarette smoking is strongly associated with insulin resistance and heart disease. Nicotine is considered the primary toxin constituent associated with smoking. However, the distinct molecular mechanism of nicotine-induced cardiac dysfunction remains unclear. Cardiomyocytes with nicotine-induced insulin resistance are characterized by decreased glucose uptake, as measured by 2-[N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-NBDG), a fluorescent derivative of glucose, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Immunoblotting was used to evaluate the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K, p85, Y607). We determined the impact of nicotine on insulin resistance and Nrf2, phospho-ERK and phospho-PI3K expression in the myocardial tissue of a mouse model. Nicotine increased ROS production and depressed insulin-induced glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, reversed nicotine-inhibited glucose uptake induced by insulin. Nicotine exposure directly inhibited Nrf2 and increased ERK phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes, which were obstructed by NAC. Further exploration of signaling cascades revealed nicotine-induced ROS involved in inhibiting PI3K/Nrf2 and activating ERK in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, the mouse model treated with nicotine showed glucose intolerance and impaired insulin tolerance accompanied by inhibited PI3K/Nrf2 and increased ERK in myocardial tissues. Thus, nicotine induces insulin resistance via the downregulation of Nrf2 activity in cardiomyocytes, which is a potential mechanism of the pharmacological effects of nicotine. This study identified potential therapeutic targets against nicotine-related cardiovascular diseases.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Ireland	31315024	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315024	heart+disease	-7732246497578572511

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of exposure to political violence on preschool children and their mothers. We explored whether these dyads are different from dyads with no known history of exposure to violence and from mother-child dyads with known exposure to domestic violence. Specifically, we explored differences in mothers' psychological status (depression and anxiety), dyadic emotional availability (EA), children's social information processing, and children's social behaviour, in a sample of 216 dyads divided into three groups (exposure to political violence, no exposure to violence, and exposure to domestic violence). We found evidence to support our hypotheses that children exposed to domestic violence exhibit the highest levels of social maladjustment with smaller but still significant differences between children exposed to political violence and children in the comparison group. As expected, the lowest EA scores were found in the exposure to domestic violence group, followed by dyads in the exposure to political violence group. Dyads belonging to the comparison group (no exposure) exhibited the highest levels of EA. These findings contribute to our understanding of the meaning of exposure to political violence, as well as sharpen the difference between exposure to political and domestic violence.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31304981	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304981	depression	-8009994379436553252

Long-term survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma during childhood or adolescence (HL survivors) are at high risk of developing treatment-related late cardiovascular sequelae. In our study we evaluated the presence of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipoproteinemia, hyperinsulinemia, obesity), endothelial and inflammatory markers (E-selectin, PAI-1, hs-CRP) and atherosclerotic changes in the common carotid arteries. Assessment was performed in 80 young adult Hodgkin lymphoma long-term survivors at more than 10 years after the potentially cardiovascular toxic anticancer treatment (median age at evaluation 34.7 years; range 24.1-40.9 years). The HL survivors were compared with 83 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers. The HL survivors showed unfavorable lipid profiles compared to those of healthy controls: triglycerides (p=0.01), total cholesterol (p=0.0004), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (p=0.005). In HL survivors, we found a higher prevalence of hypertension (p=0.004) and insulin resistance - HOMA-IR (p=0.0002). Ultrasonographic examination of both common carotid arteries revealed a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques (p=0.0009) and higher carotid intima-media thickness (p<0.0001) in HL survivors. Markers of oxidative stress (advanced oxidation protein products, oxidized low-density lipoprotein), inflammation (hs-CRP) and endothelial dysfunction (E-selectin, PAI-1) were also higher in HL survivors (p<0.0001, p=0.0002, p=0.0031, p=0.0087, p=0.004, respectively). Adult survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma during childhood and adolescence need closer follow-up with screening of metabolic syndrome components, unfavorable lifestyle factors and early management of these risk factors.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Slovakia	31305124	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305124	obesity	5688444173453700360

BACKGROUNDPersistence of HIV in sanctuary sites despite antiretroviral therapy (ART) presents a barrier to HIV remission and may affect neurocognitive function. We assessed HIV persistence in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and associations with inflammation and neurocognitive performance during long-term ART.METHODSParticipants enrolled in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) HIV Reservoirs Cohort Study (A5321) underwent concurrent lumbar puncture, phlebotomy, and neurocognitive assessment. Cell-associated HIV DNA and HIV RNA (CA-DNA, CA-RNA) were measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR). in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in cell pellets from CSF. In CSF supernatant and blood plasma, cell-free HIV RNA was quantified by qPCR with single copy sensitivity, and inflammatory biomarkers were measured by enzyme immunoassay.RESULTSSixty-nine participants (97% male, median age 50 years, CD4 696 cells/mm3, plasma HIV RNA <100 copies/mL) were assessed after a median 8.6 years of ART. In CSF, cell-free RNA was detected in 4%, CA-RNA in 9%, and CA-DNA in 48% of participants (median level 2.1 copies/103 cells). Detection of cell-free CSF HIV RNA was associated with higher plasma HIV RNA (P = 0.007). CSF inflammatory biomarkers did not correlate with HIV persistence measures. Detection of CSF CA-DNA HIV was associated with worse neurocognitive outcomes including global deficit score (P = 0.005), even after adjusting for age and nadir CD4 count.CONCLUSIONHIV-infected cells persist in CSF in almost half of individuals on long-term ART, and their detection is associated with poorer neurocognitive performance.FUNDINGThis observational study, AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) HIV Reservoirs Cohort Study (A5321), was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIAID and NIMH).	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31305262	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305262	HIV	-2940536914889279273

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) were normal but her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure was 280 mm of water with a CSF white cell count of 214. The patient showed improvement following treatment with intravenous antibiotics and acyclovir. She returned a week later with double vision and blurring in both eyes. Examination showed bilateral sixth nerve palsies and bilateral optic disc edema with left fundal hemorrhages. The spinal tap was repeated again, which showed a CSF opening pressure of 500 mm of water and the white cell count was 48. Extensive investigations for etiologies were mostly unrevealing. The patient was started on acetazolamide and topiramate combined with a large-volume therapeutic CSF tap. She continued to improve subsequently and was at the baseline functional state at three months, with complete resolution of hemorrhages and optic disc edema. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) may present with persistent abnormal CSF with a high white cell count. Therefore, this must be diagnosed with caution, as it may be misdiagnosed and wrongly treated for other causes.	2019	eng	Case Reports	United States	31309030	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309030	headache	1117455951802655890

2633	2633	142	The journal of headache and pain	Emerging evidence of occipital nerve compression in unremitting head and neck pain.	Unremitting head and neck pain (UHNP) is a commonly encountered phenomenon in Headache Medicine and may be seen in the setting of many well-defined headache types. The prevalence of UHNP is not clear, and establishing the presence of UHNP may require careful questioning at repeated patient visits. The cause of UHNP in some patients may be compression of the lesser and greater occipital nerves by the posterior cervical muscles and their fascial attachments at the occipital ridge with subsequent local perineural inflammation. The resulting pain is typically in the sub-occipital and occipital location, and, via anatomic connections between extracranial and intracranial nerves, may radiate frontally to trigeminal-innervated areas of the head. Migraine-like features of photophobia and nausea may occur with frontal radiation. Occipital allodynia is common, as is spasm of the cervical muscles. Patients with UHNP may comprise a subgroup of Chronic Migraine, as well as of Chronic Tension-Type Headache, New Daily Persistent Headache and Cervicogenic Headache. Centrally acting membrane-stabilizing agents, which are often ineffective for CM, are similarly generally ineffective for UHNP. Extracranially-directed treatments such as occipital nerve blocks, cervical trigger point injections, botulinum toxin and monoclonal antibodies directed at calcitonin gene related peptide, which act primarily in the periphery, may provide more substantial relief for UHNP; additionally, decompression of the occipital nerves from muscular and fascial compression is effective for some patients, and may result in enduring pain relief. Further study is needed to determine the prevalence of UHNP, and to understand the role of occipital nerve compression in UHNP and of occipital nerve decompression surgery in chronic head and neck pain.	2019	eng	Review	England	31266456	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266456	headache	-91139000311163410
2634	2634	74	Theriogenology	Effective biosecurity to protect North American studs and clients from emerging infectious disease.	Protecting boar studs and their clients from emerging infectious disease first involves effective biosecurity measures to keep a disease out that was not present, and second, early identification and ceasing semen distribution prior to disseminating infectious disease. Experiences in the field can best guide us as to what has been effective. Circumstances in North America in the period of 1999-2004 resulted in numerous PRRS virus (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome) negative boar studs becoming infected and disseminating virus to sow farms. Earlier detection methods were needed, and withholding of semen pending negative test results became standard. To accomplish this, diagnostic labs complied with industry requests for same day testing. At the same time, research efforts helped clarify the major routes of PRRS virus introduction into the farms. The risk of fomites and aerosol spread became viewed as major risks. Addressing issues with people and supply entry alone did not eliminate new virus entry. The implementation of air filtration during 2005-2008 had a major impact on the rate of new virus introductions into boar studs after other measures alone were unsuccessful. Risks exposed with the introduction of PED virus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea) into North America further highlighted other risk factors such as feed ingredients, trailer sanitation, and the presence of clear physical barriers. The successful adaptation of testing procedures, combined with biosecurity procedures including air filtration, has made the incidence of infectious disease introduction extremely rare in North American boar studs over the last decade. While survivability of infectious disease agents can vary in different materials or in the air, successful protocols should be applied and adjusted as needed to accommodate new information or risks. Cleary defined physical barriers for people and animal entry and exit, sanitization and/or down time on incoming supplies, risk mitigation and testing of feed ingredients, and filtration have been keys to changing the incidence of emerging infectious disease introduction into boar studs.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31285050	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285050	Diarrhea	-6642751159620064055

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists play an important role in androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) employed for locally advanced prostate cancer. A 76-year-old man presented with elevated levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA, 8.33 ng/ml). Subsequently he was diagnosed with cT3bN0M0 prostate cancer, Gleason score 4＋5. Before he was referred to our clinic, he had been administered bicalutamide (80 mg/day) daily by the referring physician, followed by subcutaneous injection of goserelin (3. 6 mg) 15 days later. The second dose of another GnRH agonist (leuprolide, 22.5 mg) was administered at his first visit to our clinic, 11 days after goserelin injection, at the discretion of the attending physician (26th day after bicalutamide administration). Bicalutamide administration was concomitantly maintained throughout the period. The patient presented with severe headache the next morning, and imaging studies detected a prominent pituitary adenoma. A trans-sphenoidal surgery was conducted for symptomatic relief. Histopathological analysis revealed a gonadotroph (follicle-stimulating hormone-secreting) pituitary adenoma. Although speculative, repeated injection of GnRH agonist was concluded to be the most likely cause of acute symptomatic gonadotroph pituitary adenoma. The irregular use of medication can cause undesirable and unanticipated adverse events. Awareness is the key to the prevention of such conditions.	2019	jpn	Journal Article	Japan	31247696	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31247696	headache	6034099213718885791

The intervention of rats with high-fat diet can replicate the ideal animal model for studying the occurrence of human nutritional obesity. The proteomics and bioinformatics analysis can help us to systematically and comprehensively study the effect of high-fat diet on rat liver. In this study, 4056 proteins were identified in rat liver by using tandem mass tag. A total of 198 proteins were significantly changed, of which 103 were significantly up-regulated and 95 were significantly down-regulated. These significant differentially expressed proteins are primarily involved in lipid metabolism and glucose metabolism processes. The intake of a high-fat diet forces the body to maintain physiological balance by regulating these key protein spots to inhibit fatty acid synthesis, promote fatty acid oxidation, and accelerate fatty acid degradation. This study enriches our understanding of metabolic disorders induced by high-fat diets at the protein level.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31311615	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311615	obesity	-6510151088126868601

Background and Purpose- Quantifying the benefit magnitude of combined endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) and intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) versus nonreperfusion care in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by large vessel occlusion would aid organization of regional stroke care systems. Methods- NINDS rt-PA Study (National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator) and SWIFT PRIME trial (Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment) patients were matched for prognosis (based on age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) and definite/likely anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (based on National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale total score and item pattern), using optimal inverse variance matching, to determine comparative outcomes with nonreperfusion care alone, IVT alone, and IVT+EVT. Results- Matching yielded 240 patients, including 80 each treated with nonreperfusion care, IVT alone, and IVT+EVT, with, respectively, mean age 67.1, 67.1, and 66.9 and presenting deficit severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) mean 15.8, 15.9, and 15.9. Outcomes at 3 months for IVT+EVT versus nonreperfusion care included freedom from disability (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-1) 48.1% versus 21.3%, P=0.0004; functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) 62.9% versus 32.6, P=0.0001; and reduced disability over all 7 modified Rankin Scale levels, common odds ratio 3.34, P<0.0001. Outcomes for IVT alone versus nonreperfusion care included: freedom from disability 30.0% versus 21.3%, P=0.28 and reduced disability over all 7 modified Rankin Scale levels, common odds ratio 1.14, P=0.65. Compared with nonreperfusion care, the number needed to treat with EVT+IVT for 1 more patient to have reduced disability was 1.8. Conclusions- Matched patient analysis across randomized trials provides evidence that the strategy of combined IVT and mechanical thrombectomy is a highly beneficial treatment strategy for acute ischemic stroke caused by large vessel occlusion patients. A reasonable effect magnitude estimate is that, among every 100 patients treated, combined IVT+EVT reperfusion therapy, compared with no reperfusion therapy, reduces long-term disability in 57, including conferring functional independence upon 30.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31311465	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311465	stroke	4422997595777504091
2642	2642	117	The Science of the total environment	Biodegradation of mixed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by pure and mixed cultures of biosurfactant producing thermophilic and thermo-tolerant bacteria.	Applicability of thermophilic and thermo-tolerant microorganisms for biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with low water solubility is an interesting strategy for improving the biodegradation efficiency. In this study, we evaluated utility of thermophilic and thermo-tolerant bacteria isolated from Unkeshwar hot spring (India) for biodegradation of four different PAHs. Water samples were enriched in mineral salt medium (MSM) containing a mixture of four PAHs compounds (anthracene: ANT, fluorene: FLU, phenanthrene: PHE and pyrene: PYR) at 37 °C and 50 °C. After growth based screening, four potent strains obtained which were identified as Aeribacillus pallidus (UCPS2), Bacillus axarquiensis (UCPD1), Bacillus siamensis (GHP76) and Bacillus subtilis subsp. inaquosorum (U277) based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Degradation of mixed PAH compounds was evaluated by pure as well as mixed cultures under shake flask conditions using MSM supplemented with 200 mg/L concentration of PAHs (50 mg/L of each compound) for 15 days at 37 °C and 50 °C. A relatively higher degradation of ANT (92%- 96%), FLU (83% - 86%), PHE (16% - 54%) and PYR (51% - 71%) was achieved at 50 °C by Aeribacillus sp. (UCPS2) and mixed culture. Furthermore, crude oil was used as a substrate to study the degradation of same PAHs using these organisms which also revealed with similar results with the higher degradation at 50 °C. Interestingly, PAH-degrading strains were also positive for biosurfactant production. Biosurfactants were identified as the variants of surfactins (lipopeptide biosurfactants) based on analytical tools and phylogenetic analysis of the surfactin genes. Overall, this study has shown that hot spring microbes may have a potential for PAHs degradation and also biosurfactant production at a higher temperature, which could provide a novel perspective for removal of PAHs residues from oil contaminated sites.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31082602	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082602	flu	-9056114023474725450

2644	2644	66	Frontiers in neurology	Use of Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers in Diagnosis and Monitoring of Rheumatoid Meningitis.	Rheumatoid meningitis is a rare extra-articular manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis, often with non-specific symptoms. In most cases brain MRI shows a patchy lepto- and pachymeningeal enhancement, but the diagnosis currently relies on examination of a meningeal biopsy with presence of plasma cells and rheumatoid noduli. Presence of IgM rheumatic factor (RF) has been found in several cases and recently four cases have shown high titer anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) in CSF, suggesting this as a potential marker for rheumatoid meningitis. We present a 62 year-old woman with sero-positive (IgM RF and anti-CCP) rheumatoid arthritis, presenting with headache and gait impairment. Brain MRI revealed the classical patchy meningeal enhancement and the diagnosis of rheumatoid meningitis was confirmed by neuropathological examination of a meningeal biopsy. Analysis of the CSF revealed positive IgM RF (92.7 IU/mL) and strongly positive anti-CCP (19,600 IU/mL) and CXCL-13 (>500 ng/L). After treatment with high-dose steroid and Rituximab the clinical symptoms resolved. A 6 month follow-up analysis of CSF showed a dramatic decrease in all these markers with negative IgM RF and a decrease in both anti-CCP (64 IU/mL) and CXCL-13 (<10 ng/L). Our case further underlines the potential use of CSF anti-CCP and IgM RF in the diagnosis of RM and the use of these markers and CXCL-13 in evaluation of treatment response. A case review of 48 cases of rheumatoid meningitis published since 2010, including, symptoms, serum, and CSF findings, treatment, and outcome is provided.	2019	eng	Case Reports	Switzerland	31293505	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293505	headache	6947862790919978120

"Intravesical immunotherapy with bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is the main treatment for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), with proven effects on reducing recurrence, progression, and death from NMIBC. However, it is not effective in all patients, and recurrence after adequate BCG therapy can frequently lead to progression to more life-threatening disease. This point-counterpoint review considers how to treat a healthy 60-yr-old patient with T1 high-grade NMIBC fitting the new definition of BCG-unresponsive disease, that is, persistent high-grade disease at 6-12mo, despite an adequate course of induction and maintenance with BCG. PATIENT SUMMARY: When T1 high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is persistent or recurs shortly after a full course of bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) plus maintenance, further BCG is not likely to work; this meets the new definition of a ""BCG unresponsive"" disease. For this situation, the safest (curative) option is removal of the bladder. If that is not an accepted alternative, then a clinical trial or combination intravesical chemotherapy or hyperchemotherapy may be another option."	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31307960	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307960	vaccine	2399228553079505025

Petrous apex cholesterol granulomas (PACG) are rare disorders that can lead to patient morbidity and must, occasionally, be drained by either endoscopic endonasal (EN) or open procedures (OP). The objective of our study was to complete a review of the literature to compare the EN and OP approaches on multiple levels, notably on safety and effectiveness. Ovid MEDLINE and Embase were used to perform a thorough literature review of all cases of PACG treated by either EN or OP dating from January 1948 to August 2017. In total, 49 articles were selected including 23 for EN (n=76) and 26 for OP (n=210). Differences were found in the incidence of preoperative hearing loss (HL) (EN 18.4%, OP 57.3%; p<0.001), headache (EN 48.7%, OP 31.2%; p=0.007), and disequilibrium (EN: 14.5%, OP 26.1%; p=0.04). Differences in lesion proximity to the sphenoid sinus (EN 23.6%, OP: 1.0%; p<0.001), clivus (EN 11.8%, OP 4.7%; p=0.03), otic capsule (EN 0.0%, OP 5.2%; p=0.03), internal auditory canal (EN 2.6%, OP 10.9%; p=0.01), and internal carotid artery (ICA) (EN 9.2%, OP 2.8%; p=0.02) were found on preoperative imaging. The EN procedure had better hearing improvement rates (EN 85.7%, OP 23.4%; p<0.001), lower complication rates (EN 7.9%, OP 17.6%; p=0.04), shorter median follow-up (EN:13.5 months, OP:37.2 months; p<0.001), and shorter time to recurrence (EN 3 months, OP 22.6 months; p=0.002) than the known OP. No differences were found in age, preoperative size, recurrence rate, operative time, stent placement, or improvement of other symptoms. Endoscopic nasal approaches, when feasible, should be favored to open procedures for PACG drainage given their better hearing improvement and less complication rates.	2019	eng	Review	Turkey	31287439	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287439	headache	-4483059513836093676

Genetic evidence strongly suggests that aberrant generation and/or clearance of the neurotoxic amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) is triggering the disease. Aβ is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the sequential cleavages of β- and γ-secretase. The latter cleavage by γ-secretase, a unique and fascinating four-component protease complex, occurs in the APP transmembrane domain thereby releasing Aβ species of 37-43 amino acids in length including the longer, highly pathogenic peptides Aβ42 and Aβ43. The lack of a precise understanding of Aβ generation as well as of the functions of other γ-secretase substrates has been one factor underlying the disappointing failure of γ-secretase inhibitors in clinical trials, but on the other side also been a major driving force for structural and in depth mechanistic studies on this key AD drug target in the past few years. Here we review recent breakthroughs in our understanding of how the γ-secretase complex recognizes substrates, of how it binds and processes β-secretase cleaved APP into different Aβ species, as well as the progress made on a question of outstanding interest, namely how clinical AD mutations in the catalytic subunit presenilin and the γ-secretase cleavage region of APP lead to relative increases of Aβ42/43. Finally, we discuss how the knowledge emerging from these studies could be used to therapeutically target this enzyme in a safe way.	2019	eng	Review	Austria	31225454	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31225454	Alzheimer	-9152398073968262186

2667	2667	23	Immunity	Pas de Deux: Control of Anti-tumor Immunity by Cancer-Associated Inflammation.	In many settings, tumor-associated inflammation, supported mainly by innate immune cells, contributes to tumor growth. Initial innate activation triggers secretion of inflammatory, regenerative, and anti-inflammatory cytokines, which in turn shape the adaptive immune response to the tumor. Here, we review the current understanding of the intricate dialog between cancer-associated inflammation and anti-tumor immunity. We discuss the changing nature of these interactions during tumor progression and the impact of the tissue environment on the anti-tumor immune response. In this context, we outline important gaps in current understanding by considering basic research and findings in the clinic. The future of cancer immunotherapy and its utility depend on improved understanding of these interactions and the ability to manipulate them in a predictable and beneficial manner.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31315033	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315033	cancer	-8353590933060505654

Limited data are available on detection of measles vaccine virus (MeVV) RNA in human subjects following vaccination. Available evidence suggests MeVV RNA can be identified up to 14 days after vaccination, with detection beyond this rare. In routine diagnostic testing, we used two real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-rPCR) assays targeting M and F genes to identify measles virus (MeV) and MeVV RNA. Confirmatory testing was performed with an N gene RT-rPCR, followed by sequence confirmation of RT-rPCR positives by semi-nested conventional RT-PCR assays targeting portions of the N, H, and L genes. We report detection and confirmation of MeVV RNA from the respiratory tract of 11 children between 100 and 800 days after most recent receipt of measles-containing vaccine. These novel findings emphasize the importance of genotyping all MeV detections and highlight the need for further work to assess whether persistent MeVV RNA represents viable virus and if transmission to close contacts can occur.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31295941	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295941	vaccine	3056097063387494549
2672	2672	682	Nature reviews. Neurology	The pro-remyelination properties of microglia in the central nervous system.	Microglia are resident macrophages of the CNS that are involved in its development, homeostasis and response to infection and damage. Microglial activation is a common feature of neurological disorders, and although in some instances this activation can be damaging, protective and regenerative functions of microglia have been revealed. The most prominent example of the regenerative functions is a role for microglia in supporting regeneration of myelin after injury, a process that is critical for axonal health and relevant to numerous disorders in which loss of myelin integrity is a prevalent feature, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease and motor neuron disease. Although drugs that are intended to promote remyelination are entering clinical trials, the mechanisms by which remyelination is controlled and how microglia are involved are not completely understood. In this Review, we discuss work that has identified novel regulators of microglial activation - including molecular drivers, population heterogeneity and turnover - that might influence their pro-remyelination capacity. We also discuss therapeutic targeting of microglia as a potential approach to promoting remyelination.	2019	eng	Review	England	31256193	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31256193	Alzheimer	-9086955082453789880

Here we evaluated the humoral and cellular immune responses induced by vaccination of colostrum-deprived calves and calves that received equivalent amounts of colostrum preparations that differed in the presence or absence of maternal immune cells but contained the same quantity and quality of anti-foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) antibodies. Three groups of 32-d-old calves (n = 3 per group) were deprived of colostrum and fed either whole immune colostrum or a cell-free colostrum preparation containing only anti-FMDV antibodies. All groups were immunized with 1 dose of an oil-adjuvanted commercial vaccine. Blood samples were collected periodically before vaccination and weekly after vaccination. Immune responses specific to FMDV were assessed based on T-cell proliferation, IFN-γ production, total and neutralizing serum antibodies, and isotype profile. All vaccinated calves developed IFN-γ and lymphoproliferative responses, irrespective of the colostrum received.

HEV infection has been described in solid-organ transplantation and hematology patients, but for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) recipients, only small cohorts are available. This retrospective nationwide multi-center series aimed to describe HEV diagnostic practices in alloHSCT French centers, and the course of infection in the context of alloHSCT. Twenty-nine out of 37 centers participated. HEV search in case of liver function tests (LFT) abnormalities was never performed in 24% of centers, occasionally in 55%, and systematically in 21%. Twenty-five cases of active HEV infection were diagnosed in seven centers, all because of LFT abnormalities, by blood nucleic acid testing. HEV infection was diagnosed in three patients before alloHSCT; HEV infection did not influence transplantation planning, and resolved spontaneously before or after alloHSCT. Twenty-two patients were diagnosed a median of 283 days after alloHSCT. Nine patients (41%) had spontaneous viral clearance, mostly after immunosuppressive treatment decrease. Thirteen patients (59%) received ribavirin, with sustained viral clearance in 11/12 evaluable patients. We observed three HEV recurrences but no HEV-related death or liver failure, nor evolution to cirrhosis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31284515	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284515	Cirrhosis	-6245524727898921842

Digital treatment has the potential to address these barriers, yet long term use of digital psychotherapy is poor. This paper presents data from a mixed-methods, online survey to document concerns patients with depression face when given the choice of in-person psychotherapy and digital psychotherapy. Participants were 164 adults living in the United States who had previously used or considered psychotherapy for depression. Rural-dwelling and racial/ethnic minority (Native American, African American, and Spanish-speaking) respondents were purposively sampled. Participants were asked their preferences for and opinions about four treatment modalities: self-guided digital, peer-supported digital, expert-guided digital, or in-person psychotherapy. Less than half (44.5%) of participants preferred in-person psychotherapy, 25.6% preferred self-guided digital treatment, 19.7% preferred expert-guided digital treatment, and 8.5% peer-supported digital treatment. Principal themes extracted from qualitative analysis centered on the efficacy of digital treatment, access to digital treatment, concerns about peer-supported care, confidentiality and privacy concerns, preference for in-person treatment, skepticism about self-guided therapy, and the impact of social anxiety on the use of video-chat based care. Future development of digital psychotherapy will need to address concerns regarding efficacy, privacy, data security, and methods to enhance motivation to use these treatments.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31304356	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304356	depression	-7905002887579197656

Background Studies on the determinants of carotid intima-media thickness ( CIMT ), a marker of sub-clinical atherosclerosis, mostly come from white, Asian, and diasporan black populations. We present CIMT data from sub-Saharan Africa, which is experiencing a rising burden of cardiovascular diseases and infectious diseases. Methods and Results The H3 (Human Hereditary and Health) in Africa's AWI-Gen (African-Wits-INDEPTH partnership for Genomic) study is a cross-sectional study conducted in adults aged 40 to 60 years from Burkina Faso, Kenya, Ghana, and South Africa. Cardiovascular disease risk and ultrasonography of the CIMT of right and left common carotids were measured. Multivariable linear and mixed-effect multilevel regression modeling was applied to determine factors related to CIMT. Data included 8872 adults (50.8% men), mean age of 50±6 years with age- and sex-adjusted mean (±SE) CIMT of 640±123μm. Participants from Ghana and Burkina Faso had higher CIMT compared with other sites. Age (β = 6.77, 95%CI [6.34-7.19]), body mass index (17.6[12.5-22.8]), systolic blood pressure (7.52[6.21-8.83]), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (5.08[2.10-8.06]) and men (10.3[4.75- 15.9]) were associated with higher CIMT. Smoking was associated with higher CIMT in men. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-12.2 [-17.9- -6.41]), alcohol consumption (-13.5 [-19.1--7.91]) and HIV (-8.86 [-15.7--2.03]) were inversely associated with CIMT. Conclusions Given the rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases risk factors in sub-Saharan Africa, atherosclerotic diseases may become a major pan-African epidemic unless preventive measures are taken particularly for prevention of hypertension, obesity, and smoking. HIV -specific studies are needed to fully understand the association between HIV and CIMT in sub-Saharan Africa.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31304842	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304842	obesity	7529823674661315431

External stimuli such as light, magnetic fields or ultrasounds allow for controlled drug release from nanocarriers with spatiotemporal resolution. Such tetherless approaches may become a straightforward solution to overcome the specificity problems typically associated with nanomedicines. Most of current nanomedicines suffer of very low specificity in vivo, thus rendering efficient targeted delivery among the most wanted breakthroughs in the fields of nanotechnology and medicine. Here we present a sonosensitive, sub-micrometric layer-by-layer capsule system for ultrasound-controlled delivery of macromolecules in vivo. As a proof of concept, the serine protease recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), a thrombolytic drug widely employed for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke and other thromboembolic pathologies, is used as encapsulated active compound. The activity of encapsulated rtPA and its ultrasound-induced delivery from the cavity of the capsules are demonstrated. We show, first, that rtPA encapsulation prevents its endogenous biological inactivation and do not interfere with the thrombolytic activity of the drug. Second, upon ultrasound application, delivery of rtPA promotes breakdown of blood clots in vitro. Finally, the ultrasound-triggered in vivo delivery of rtPA from capsules intravenously administrated in mice is demonstrated.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31310784	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310784	stroke	7850245260835292221
2696	2696	276	Journal of the history of the behavioral sciences	Equanimity: The somatization of a moral sentiment from the eighteenth to late twentieth century.	"Over the past 40 years, mindfulness-based therapies (MBTs) have gained a reputation among the biomedical community for their ability to contribute to health, mental capital, and human flourishing. Recently, however, critical mindfulness scholars have questioned the moral import of MBTs, claiming that, in modernizing meditation, they strip Buddhist practices of their ethical and soteriological content. Inspired by Harrington and Dunne's (2015, p. 630) recent call to historicize this present discontent, I offer an account for this perceived ""de-ethicization"" of mindfulness, locating it in a long history of changes in the ontological infrastructures supporting moral reasoning from the eighteenth century onwards. Through the example of equanimity-a virtue that has been a part of Western and Eastern character ethics and theories of flourishing from the ancient period to the modern age-I show how, from the eighteenth century, research in the natural sciences on nervous diseases, stress, and relaxation, provided a frame for rethinking moral equanimity as a somatic experience of physiological calm. This transformation reaches its peak in the late twentieth century in research on mindfulness, which builds upon that tradition by folding into its ambit Eastern conceptions of equanimity as well. Insofar as modern MBTs continue to somatize moral virtues, I argue that they raise questions about the degree to which they are conducive to human flourishing and well-being, as opposed to the related but narrower notions of health and mental capital."	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313322	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313322	stress	-3687965339291665275

We recently identified inhibitors targeting Mycobacterium marinum MelF (Rv1936) by in silico analysis, which exhibited bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity against M. marinum and M. tuberculosis in vitro. Herein, we evaluated the effect of best four inhibitors (# 5175552, # 6513745, # 5255829, # 9125618) obtained from the ChemBridge compound libraries, on intracellular replication and persistence of bacteria within IFN-γ activated murine RAW264.7 and human THP-1 macrophages infected with M. marinum. Inhibitors # 5175552 and # 6513745 significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the intracellular replication of bacilli during day 7 post-infection (p.i.) within RAW264.7 and THP-1 macrophages infected at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of ~1.0. These observations were substantiated by electron microscopy, which revealed the protective effect of # 5175552 in clearing the bacilli inside murine macrophages. Strikingly, # 6513745 displayed synergism with isoniazid against M. marinum in murine macrophages, whereas # 5175552 significantly suppressed (p < 0.05) the persistent bacilli during day 10-14 p.i. in infected RAW264.7 and THP-1 macrophages (MOI of ~ 0.1). Moreover, # 5175552 and # 6513745 were non-cytotoxic to host macrophages at both 1X and 5X MIC. Further validation of these inhibitors against M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages and animal models has potential for development as novel anti-tubercular agents.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31300732	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300732	tuberculosis	1639450243805666792

Functional neuroimaging techniques (i.e. single photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging) have been used to assess the neural correlates of anosognosia in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A systematic review of this literature was performed, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses statement, on PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases. Twenty-five articles met all inclusion criteria. Specifically, four brain connectivity and 21 brain perfusion, metabolism, and activation articles. Anosognosia is associated in MCI with frontal lobe and cortical midline regional dysfunction (reduced perfusion and activation), and with reduced parietotemporal metabolism. Reduced within and between network connectivity is observed in the default mode network regions of AD patients with anosognosia compared to AD patients without anosognosia and controls. During initial stages of cognitive decline in anosognosia, reduced indirect neural activity (i.e. perfusion, metabolism, and activation) is associated with the cortical midline regions, followed by the parietotemporal structures in later stages and culminating in frontotemporal dysfunction. Although the current evidence suggests differences in activation between AD or MCI patients with anosognosia and healthy controls, more evidence is needed exploring the differences between MCI and AD patients with and without anosognosia using resting state and task related paradigms.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31161466	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161466	Alzheimer	7978090893338710234
2710	2710	795	Molecular cell	SENP1-Sirt3 Signaling Controls Mitochondrial Protein Acetylation and Metabolism.	Sirt3, as a major mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylase, is required for mitochondrial metabolic adaption to various stresses. However, how to regulate Sirt3 activity responding to metabolic stress remains largely unknown. Here, we report Sirt3 as a SUMOylated protein in mitochondria. SUMOylation suppresses Sirt3 catalytic activity. SUMOylation-deficient Sirt3 shows elevated deacetylation on mitochondrial proteins and increased fatty acid oxidation. During fasting, SUMO-specific protease SENP1 is accumulated in mitochondria and quickly de-SUMOylates and activates Sirt3. SENP1 deficiency results in hyper-SUMOylation of Sirt3 and hyper-acetylation of mitochondrial proteins, which reduces mitochondrial metabolic adaption responding to fasting. Furthermore, we find that fasting induces SENP1 translocation into mitochondria to activate Sirt3. The studies on mice show that Sirt3 SUMOylation mutation reduces fat mass and antagonizes high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity via increasing oxidative phosphorylation and energy expenditure. Our results reveal that SENP1-Sirt3 signaling modulates Sirt3 activation and mitochondrial metabolism during metabolic stress.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31302001	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302001	obesity	-5689187996536546877

Sleep deprivation (SD) is known to be associated with metabolic disorders and chronic diseases. Complex metabolic alterations induced by SD at the omics scale and the associated biomarker candidates have been proposed. However, in vivo systemic and local metabolic shift patterns of the metabolome and lipidome in acute and chronic partial SD models remain to be elucidated. In the present study, the serum, hypothalamus, and hippocampus CA1 of sleep-deprived rats (SD rats) from acute and chronic sleep restriction models were analyzed using three different omics platforms for the discovery and mechanistic assessment of systemic and local SD-induced dysregulated metabolites. We found a similar pattern of systemic metabolome alterations between two models, for which the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was AUC = 0.813 and 0.836 with the pseudotargeted and untargeted metabolomics approach, respectively. However, SD-induced systemic lipidome alterations were significantly different and appeared to be model-dependent (AUC = 0.374). Comprehensive pathway analysis of the altered lipidome and metabolome in the hypothalamus indicated the abnormal behavior of eight metabolic and lipid metabolic pathways. The metabolism of the hippocampus CA1 was subtle in two SD models. Collectively, these results extend our understanding of the quality of sleep and suggest metabolic targets in developing diagnostic biomarkers for better SD control.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313932	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313932	stress	-1129449063360470561

The importance of social components of health has been emphasized both in epidemiology and public health. This paper highlights the significant impact of social components on health outcomes in a novel way. Introducing the concept of sociomarkers, which are measurable indicators of social conditions in which a patient is embedded, we employed a machine learning approach that uses both biomarkers and sociomarkers to identify asthma patients at risk of a hospital revisit after an initial visit with an accuracy of 66%. The analysis has been performed over an integrated dataset consisting of individual-level patient information such as gender, race, insurance type, and age, along with ZIP code-level sociomarkers such as poverty level, blight prevalence, and housing quality. Using this uniquely integrated database, we then compare the traditional biomarker-based risk model and the sociomarker-based risk model. A biomarker-based predictive model yields an accuracy of 65% and the sociomarker-based model predicts with an accuracy of 61%. Without knowing specific symptom-related features, the sociomarker-based model can correctly predict two out of three patients at risk. We systematically show that sociomarkers play an important role in predicting health outcomes at the individual level in pediatric asthma cases. Additionally, by merging multiple data sources with detailed neighborhood-level data, we directly measure the importance of residential conditions for predicting individual health outcomes.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31304329	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304329	asthma	-3745582971859460684

2723	2723	481	Inflammopharmacology	Role of flavonoids in thrombotic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory diseases.	The failure of mechanisms of natural anti-coagulation either due to genetic impairment or due to severe external injuries may result in a condition called thrombosis. This is believed to be the primary cause for a variety of life-threatening conditions such as: heart attack, stroke, pulmonary embolism, thrombophlebitis, and deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The growing number of these incidents requires an alternative anti-coagulant or anti-thrombotic agent that has minimal side effects and improved efficiency. For decades, plant polyphenols, especially flavonoids, were known for their vital role in preventing various diseases such as cancer. Mitigating excessive oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) with anti-oxidant-rich flavonoids may reduce the risk of hyper-activation of platelets, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), pain, and thrombosis. Furthermore, flavonoids may mitigate endothelial dysfunction (ED), which generally correlates to the development of coronary artery and vascular diseases. Flavonoids also reduce the risk of atherosclerosis and atherothrombotic disease by inhibiting excessive tissue factor (TF) availability in the endothelium. Although the role of flavonoids in CVD is widely discussed, to the best of our knowledge, their role as anti-thrombotic lead has not been discussed. This review aims to focus on the biological uses of dietary flavonoids and their role in the treatment of various coagulation disorders, and may provide some potential lead to the drug discovery process in this area.	2019	eng	Review	Switzerland	31309484	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309484	stroke	-1104501717379772664

2730	2730	34	American family physician	Acupuncture for Pain.	Acupuncture has been increasingly used as an integrative or complementary therapy for pain. It is well-tolerated with little risk of serious adverse effects. Traditional acupuncture and nontraditional techniques, such as electroacupuncture and dry needling, often result in reported pain improvement. Multiple factors may contribute to variability in acupuncture's therapeutic effects, including needling technique, number of needles used, duration of needle retention, acupuncture point specificity, number of treatments, and numerous subjective (psychological) factors. Controlled trials have been published on pain syndromes, such as acupuncture for acute and chronic low back pain, knee osteoarthritis, headache, myofascial pain, neck pain, and fibromyalgia. For some conditions, enough data are available for systematic evaluations or meta-analyses. Acupuncture may provide modest benefits in the treatment of chronic low back pain, tension headache and chronic headache, migraine headache prophylaxis, and myofascial pain. Although patients receiving acupuncture for acute low back pain and knee osteoarthritis report less pain, the improvement with true (verum) acupuncture over sham acupuncture is not clinically significant for these conditions. These two conditions illustrate a recurring pattern in acupuncture trials, in which the additional improvement that can be attributed to verum over sham acupuncture, even when statistically significant, is of less clinical significance. This pattern supports the notion that acupuncture treatment has a notable placebo response, or meaning response, that may be responsible for much of its demonstrated benefits. For certain patients, especially those who are unresponsive or intolerant to standard therapies, acupuncture is a reasonable treatment option.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31305037	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305037	headache	7511744555558105059
2731	2731	703	The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics	Effect of Pregnancy on paroxetine-induced adiposity and glucose intolerance in mice.	Long term use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) targeting the serotonin transporter (SERT) has been suggested to be associated with an increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Previously, using a murine knockout model of SERT, we showed that estrogen suppression is involved in SERT deficiency-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in non-pregnant mice. The present study investigated the effects of chronic paroxetine treatment on adiposity and glucose tolerance in mice before and during pregnancy. Chronic paroxetine treatment in non-pregnant mice resulted in visceral adiposity and glucose intolerance accompanied by reduced circulating 17β-estradiol levels and ovarian expression of the aromatase (Cyp19a1). Remarkably, pregnancy significantly reduced adiposity and improved glucose tolerance in paroxetine-treated mice by rebooting ovarian Cyp19a1 expression and 17β-estradiol production. These effects appear to be reversible as ovarian Cyp19a1 expression and circulating 17β-estradiol returned to pre-pregnancy levels soon following parturition. Similar to pregnant mice, 17β-estradiol replacement treatment in non-pregnant mice reduced paroxetine-induced adiposity. Our findings further suggested that modulation of estrogen synthesis underlies the observed metabolic adverse effects of SSRIs. Although our data revealed a transit reversal effect of pregnancy on SSRI-induced metabolic abnormalities, these observations are experimental and limited to mice. The use of SSRIs during human pregnancy should be cautioned due to potential adverse effects to the fetuses.

2732	2732	583	Stroke	Patterns and Outcomes of Endovascular Therapy in Mild Stroke.	Background and Purpose- We aimed to evaluate the current practice patterns, safety and outcomes of patients who receive endovascular therapy (EVT) having mild neurological symptoms. Methods- From Jan 2010 to Jan 2018, 127,794 ischemic stroke patients were enrolled in the Florida-Puerto Rico Stroke Registry. Patients presenting within 24 hours of symptoms who received EVT were classified into mild (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≤5) or moderate/severe (NIHSS>5) categories. Differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Results- Among 4110 EVT patients (median age, 73 [interquartile range=20] years; 50% women), 446 (11%) had NIHSS ≤5. Compared with NIHSS >5, those with NIHSS ≤5 arrived later to the hospital (median, 138 versus 101 minutes), were less likely to receive intravenous alteplase (30% versus 43%), had a longer door-to-puncture time (median, 167 versus 115 minutes) and more likely treated in South Florida (64% versus 53%). In multivariable analysis younger age, private insurance (versus Medicare), history of hypertension, prior independent ambulation and hospital size were independent characteristics associated with NIHSS ≤5. Among EVT patients with NIHSS ≤5, 76% were discharged home/rehabilitation and 64% were able to ambulate independently at discharge as compared with 53% and 32% of patients with NIHSS >5. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 4% of mild stroke EVT patients and 6.4% in those with NIHSS >5. Conclusions- Despite lack of evidence-based recommendations, 11% of patients receiving EVT in clinical practice have mild neurological presentations. Individual, hospital and geographic disparities are observed among endovascularly treated patients based on the severity of clinical symptoms. Our data suggest safety and overall favorable outcomes for EVT patients with mild stroke.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31303151	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303151	stroke	-5570795524983603787

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) currently represents approximately 50% of heart failure (HF) cases in the USA and is increasingly recognized as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Recent data suggest that the prevalence of HFpEF relative to HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is increasing at a rate of 1% per year. With an aging population and increasing risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus, HFpEF will soon be the most prevalent HF phenotype. Two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) has been used to diagnose HFpEF specifically by focusing on the longitudinal systolic function of the left ventricle (LV). Yet there are many patients with HFpEF in whom there are no differences in LV global longitudinal systolic strain, but there are changes in left atrial function and structure. There are several proposed pathophysiological mechanisms for HFpEF such as endothelial dysfunction, interactions among proteins, signaling pathways, and myocardial bioenergetics. Yet only one specific therapy, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, spironolactone, is recommended as a treatment for patients with HFpEF. However, spironolactone does not address many of the pathophysiologic changes that occur in HFpEF, thus new novel therapeutic agents are needed. With the limited available therapies, clinicians should use STE to assess for the presence of this syndrome in their patients to provide effective diagnosis and management.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31303358	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303358	aging	8355302955998803709

Most of current influenza virus vaccines fail to develop a strong immunity at lung mucosae (site of viral entry) due to sub-optimal vaccination protocols (e.g. inactivated virus administered by parenteral injections). Mucosal immunity could be improved by using locally-delivered vaccines containing appropriate adjuvants. Here we show, in a mouse model, that inclusion of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in virus-inactivated flu vaccine resulted in reduction of viral loads and prevention of excessive lung inflammation following influenza infection. Concomitantly, AgNPs enhanced specific IgA secreting plasma cells and antibodies titers, a hallmark of successful mucosal immunity. Moreover, vaccination in the presence of AgNPs but not with gold nanoparticles, protected mice from lethal flu. Compared with other commercial adjuvants (squalene/oil-based emulsion) or silver salts, AgNPs stimulated stronger antigen specific IgA production with lower toxicity by promoting bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) neogenesis, and acted as a bona fide mucosal adjuvant.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31279103	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31279103	flu	-2400879112398974660
2737	2737	158	Acta biomaterialia	Bio-instructive materials for musculoskeletal regeneration.	The prevalence and cost of disorders affecting the musculoskeletal system are predicted to rise significantly in the coming years due to the aging global population and the increase of associated risk factors. Despite being the second largest cause of disability, the clinical options for therapeutic intervention remain limited. The clinical translation of cell-based therapies for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders faces many challenges including maintenance of cell survival in the harsh in vivo environment and the lack of control over regulating cell phenotype upon implantation. In order to address these challenges, the development of bio-instructive materials to modulate cell behavior has taken center stage as a strategy to increase the therapeutic potential of various cell populations. However, the determination of the necessary cues for a specific application and how these signals should be presented from a biomaterial remains elusive. This review highlights recent biochemical and physical strategies used to engineer bio-instructive materials for the repair of musculoskeletal tissues. There is a particular emphasis on emerging efforts such as the engineering of immunomodulatory and antibacterial materials, as well as the incorporation of these strategies into biofabrication and organ-on-a-chip approaches. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Disorders affecting the musculoskeletal system affect individuals across the lifespan and have a profound effect on mobility and quality of life. While small defects in many tissues can heal successfully, larger defects are often unable to heal or instead heal with inferior quality fibrous tissue and require clinical intervention. Cell-based therapies are a promising option for clinical translation, yet challenges related to maintaining cell survival and instructing cell phenotype upon implantation have limited the success of this approach. Bio-instructive materials provide an exciting opportunity to modulate cell behavior and enhance the efficacy of cell-based approaches for musculoskeletal repair. However, the identification of critical instructive cues and how to present these stimuli is a focus of intense investigation. This review highlights recent biochemical and physical strategies used to engineer bio-instructive materials for the repair of musculoskeletal tissues, while also considering exciting progress in the engineering of immunomodulatory and antibacterial materials.	2019	eng	Review	England	31302298	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302298	aging	7203367456821804602

Malaria and babesiosis are bloodborne protozoan infections for which the emergence of drug-resistant strains poses a threat. Our previous phage display cDNA screens established the essentiality of Plasmodium falciparum signal peptide peptidase (SPP) in asexual development at the blood stage of malaria infection. Given the structural similarities between SPP inhibitors and HIV protease inhibitors, we screened ten HIV protease inhibitors and selected Lopinavir and Atazanavir for their ability to inhibit PfSPP activity. Using a transcription-based assay, we observed that Lopinavir inhibits both parasite-and host-derived SPP activities whereas Atazanavir inhibited only parasite derived SPP activity. Consistent with their inhibitory effect on Plasmodium growth, both Lopinavir and Atazanavir strongly inhibited intraerythrocytic Babesia microti growth ex vivo. Moreover, Lopinavir prevented the steep rise in Babesia microti parasitemia typically observed in rag1-deficient mice. Our data provide first evidence that inhibition of parasite-derived SPPs by HIV protease inhibitors offers a promising therapeutic avenue for the treatment of severe babesiosis and infections caused by other Apicomplexa parasites.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31311649	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311649	HIV	6634206168889468590

2742	2742	722	NPJ science of food	Food for thought: how nutrition impacts cognition and emotion.	More than one-third of American adults are obese and statistics are similar worldwide. Caloric intake and diet composition have large and lasting effects on cognition and emotion, especially during critical periods in development, but the neural mechanisms for these effects are not well understood. A clear understanding of the cognitive-emotional processes underpinning desires to over-consume foods can assist more effective prevention and treatments of obesity. This review addresses recent work linking dietary fat intake and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid dietary imbalance with inflammation in developing, adult, and aged brains. Thus, early-life diet and exposure to stress can lead to cognitive dysfunction throughout life and there is potential for early nutritional interventions (e.g., with essential micronutrients) for preventing these deficits. Likewise, acute consumption of a high-fat diet primes the hippocampus to produce a potentiated neuroinflammatory response to a mild immune challenge, causing memory deficits. Low dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can also contribute to depression through its effects on endocannabinoid and inflammatory pathways in specific brain regions leading to synaptic phagocytosis by microglia in the hippocampus, contributing to memory loss. However, encouragingly, consumption of fruits and vegetables high in polyphenolics can prevent and even reverse age-related cognitive deficits by lowering oxidative stress and inflammation. Understanding relationships between diet, cognition, and emotion is necessary to uncover mechanisms involved in and strategies to prevent or attenuate comorbid neurological conditions in obese individuals.	2017	eng	Review	England	31304249	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304249	obesity	-4640750981890093183

2747	2747	249	Frontiers in psychology	The Effect of Emotional Arousal on Inhibition of Return Among Youth With Depressive Tendency.	The occurrence and development of depressive symptoms were thought to be closely related to excessive attention to negative information. However, the evidences among researchers were inconsistent on whether negative emotional information could induce attention bias in depressed individuals. One possible hypothesis is that the arousal level of stimuli regulates the attention bias of depressed individuals to negative emotional stimuli. In the current study, we directly assessed the attentional inhibition of depression-tendency individuals to different arousal levels of negative emotional faces. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to distinguish the depression-tendency group from the health group. Thirty-three participants in each group completed a simpler cue-target task that comprised four kinds of experimental conditions, in which group was an inter-subject variable, while cue validity, arousal level, and stimulus onset asynchrony were internal variables. By subtracting the reaction time under the valid cue from the reaction time under the invalid cue, we got the magnitudes of inhibition of return (IOR), which reflected the effective suppression of previously noticed irrelevant information. We found that, in health group, the IOR effect was smaller at high arousal level than at low arousal level. This means that even in the normal population, higher arousal level of negative emotional information could weaken the individual's attention inhibition ability. While in the depression-tendency group, the IOR effect only appeared at low arousal level condition, but in the high cue condition it showed the reversal pattern, that was, the cue effect. These results indicated for the first time that the attention bias of depressive individuals to negative emotional stimuli was influenced by the arousal level of stimuli, and the negative stimuli with high arousal level were more difficult to suppress.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31312156	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312156	depression	2171312647242674161

Adult	Signs and symptoms method in neuropsychology: A preliminary investigation of a standardized clinical interview for assessment of cognitive decline in dementia.	Psychologists usually perform a preliminary assessment of the person's cognitive status through a brief interview conducted before the formal testing. However, this exam has not yet been standardized with ad hoc recommendations in psychology literature. In this work, a standard observational NeuroPsychological Examination (NPE) designed for psychologists was proposed, and its clinical effectiveness evaluated. The NPE was administered to patients referred to a neuropsychological service in a memory clinic over a 2-year period. The NPEs of the patients with Alzheimer dementia (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and healthy controls (HC) were retrospectively retrieved. Comparisons among the three groups were conducted. Abnormalities/signs identified during the NPE in the AD and VaD groups are more numerous compared to those reported in the HC group. About 80% of HCs show none or only one abnormal sign. Vice versa, 87.5% of both AD and VaD patients show three or more abnormalities. Accordingly, the NPE has 0.88 (95%CI = 0.81-0.95) sensitivity and 0.95 (95%CI = 0.88-1.02) specificity for detecting cognitive decline when a cut-point of three or more signs is applied. Some significant differences also emerge on the number of pathological signs between AD and VaD patients. NPE is a promising tool with demonstrated diagnostic utility in dementia patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31269816	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31269816	Alzheimer	2867605706298498445

2752	2752	182	Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics	B-cell restriction - an alternative piece to the puzzle.	"Effective vaccination is based on three critical aspects of the B-cell response towards infectious agents: (i) that B-cells can generate specific antibodies towards a vast molecular diversity of antigens; proteins, sugars, DNA and lipids. There seems to be no limit to the ability to raise antibodies to everything. (ii) once stimulated, B-cells can perfect their antibodies through affinity maturation to complement every nook and cranny of the epitope and (iii) that the pathogen remains genetically stable and does not change to any great extent. Thus, antibodies produced against the vaccine and subsequent boosts recognize the viral virulent field isolates in future encounters and effectively knock them out. However, some vaccine targets, such as flu virus and HIV, are extremely genetically dynamic. The rapid genetic drift of these viruses renders them moving targets which assist in their ability to evade immune surveillance. Here we postulate that in the case of hyper-variable pathogens the B-cell response actually might be ""too good"". We propose that restricting B-cell activities may prove effective in counteracting the genetic diversity of variant viruses such as flu and HIV. We suggest two levels of ""B-cell restriction"": (i) to focus the B-cell response exclusively towards neutralizing epitopes by creating epitope-based immunogens; (ii) to restrict affinity maturation of B-cells to prevent the production of overly optimized exquisitely specific antibodies. Together, these ""B-cell restrictions"" provide a new modality for vaccine design."	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	30945969	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30945969	flu	1450769039556893440

Epidemiologic and cross-sectional studies suggest that early life farming and animal exposures are associated with major health benefits, influencing immune development and modifying the subsequent risk of allergic diseases, including asthma. The Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort (WISC) study was established in central Wisconsin to test the hypothesis that early life animal farm exposures are associated with distinct innate immune cell maturation trajectories, decreased allergen sensitization and reduced respiratory viral illness burden during the first 2 years of life. Beginning in 2013, a total of 240 families have been enrolled, 16,522 biospecimens have been collected, and 4098 questionnaires have been administered and entered into a secure database. Study endpoints include nasal respiratory virus identification and respiratory illness burden score, allergic sensitization, expression of allergic disease, and anti-viral immune response maturation and profiles. The WISC study prospective design, broad biospecimen collections, and unique US rural community will provide insights into the role of environmental exposures on early life immune maturation profiles associated with protection from allergic sensitization and significant respiratory viral disease burden. The WISC study findings will ultimately inform development of new strategies to promote resistance to severe respiratory viral illnesses and design primary prevention approaches for allergic diseases for all infants.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31311588	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311588	asthma	-885453047081832598
2756	2756	90	European journal of medical genetics	Mutation spectrum of MMACHC in Chinese pediatric patients with cobalamin C disease: A case series and literature review.	Cobalamin (cbl) C disease is a rare autosomal recessive inheritance disease, which is the most common cobalamin metabolic disorder. Its clinical phenotype involves multiple systems with varying degrees of severity, where in mild cases can be asymptomatic for many years, whereas severe cases may cause death during the neonatal period. The disease is caused by mutations in the MMACHC gene located on chromosome 1p34.1 that contains 5 exons; among which, exons 1-4 have an 849 bp coding sequence that encodes a protein containing 282 amino acids. Through clinical physical examination and laboratory tests, especially blood and urine screening, we found 28 cblC pediatric patients with clinical manifestations, such as mental retardation, motor development delay, epilepsy, metabolic acidosis, vomiting and diarrhea. By Sanger sequencing, we found homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations of MMACHC in 27 of the patients, and single heterozygous mutation of MMACHC in one of them. The c.609G > A, c.658-660delAAG, c.80A > G and c.482G > A mutations accounted for 43.64% (24/55), 10.91% (6/55), 9.09% (5/55) and 7.27% (4/55) of all the mutations, respectively. This spectrum finding is basically consistent with the previously reported data in Chinese patients. The most common c.609G > A mutation may likely lead to early-onset cblC disease. In previous literature involving a large sample of Caucasian cblC cases, the mutation spectrum of MMACHC gene is almost completely different from that of the Chinese population. The most common mutations in the Caucasian population were c.271dupA, c.394C > T and c.331C > T, which account for 48.05% (542/1128), 13.65% (154/1128) and 7.36% (83/1128) of all the mutant alleles, respectively. The c.271dupA mutation and c.331C > T mutation were mainly associated with early-onset cblC in children less than 1 year old, whilst the c.394C > T mutation was mainly associated with late-onset cblC patients characterised by isolated acute nervous system abnormalities. We also analysed the cause behind the different mutation spectrum of MMACHC gene between the Chinese and Caucasian populations.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31279840	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31279840	Diarrhea	-7499831854130267106

Our animal model suggests, for the first time, that Braak's hypothesis that human AD originates with pretangle stages is plausible. LC pretangle progression here generates both preclinical AD pathological changes and cognitive decline. The odor discrimination deficits are similar to human odor identification deficits seen with aging and preclinical AD. When initiated in aged rats, pretangle stages progress rapidly and cause LC cell loss. These age-related outcomes are associated with a severe learning impairment consistent with memory decline in Braak stages III-IV.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31266535	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266535	Alzheimer	-2962461122453899874

HLA-I associated HIV adaptation is known to negatively impact disease progression and CD8 T-cell responses. We aimed to assess how HLA-I associated adaptation impacts HIV vaccine-induced CD8 T-cell responses in two past vaccine efficacy trials. We found that vaccine-encoded adapted epitopes were less immunogenic than vaccine-encoded non-adapted epitopes, and adapted epitope-specific responses were less polyfunctional than non-adapted epitope-specific responses. Along those lines, vaccine recipients with higher HLA-I adaptation to the Gag vaccine insert mounted less polyfunctional CD8 T-cell responses at the protein-level. Response breadth, which correlated with viral control in recipients who became infected, is also dampened by HLA-I adaptation. These findings suggest that HLA-I associated adaptation is an important consideration for strategies aiming to induce robust CD8 T-cell responses.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31301135	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301135	vaccine	-1306208577536428610

Epidural disc extrusion is extremely rare and may cause cauda equina syndrome. This is a surgical emergency and needs rapid decompression. Although cauda equina is commonly caused by disc herniation, this is an unusual presentation with epidural disc extrusion. We present a very rare case of Cauda Equina syndrome, resulting from an epidural disc extrusion at L3-L4 level. Patient care and progress notes were reviewed along with pre-, post-, and intra-operative radiological imaging. Here, a 19-year-old male with a past medical history of type I diabetes mellitus, fell asleep on a chair at home in an unusual position and was unable to walk on awakening. The patient developed progressive neurological deficits including bilateral foot drop along with bowel and bladder dysfunction. In addition, he experienced paresthesia and severe lower back pain unresponsive to steroids. Pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a herniated disk epidurally with disc extrusion and mass effect and compression at the L3-L4 level, wrapping around the posterior aspect of the dura. A diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome was made and surgical decompression was performed. Using microsurgical technique and fluoroscopic guidance, a bilateral laminectomy of L3 was achieved with bilateral partial laminectomy of L4, with bilateral foraminotomy of L4. After removal of the lamina, a mass was immediately visualized in the posterior epidural space. Further dissection of the substance and following it posteriorly, identified the mass as a portion of the extruded disc. Post-operatively, the patient experienced rapid recovery. In conclusion, this case demonstrates that a disc extrusion can occur within the epidural space and can cause cauda equina syndrome. As this presentation is unusual, surgeons must be aware that they may encounter disc mass in unexpected locations, in a clinically delayed setting, long after the initial onset of symptoms.	2019	eng	Case Reports	United States	31312571	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312571	diabetes	881166463209244600

There is a dearth of information regarding the reliability of non-invasive measures of vascular function taken in a single testing session. This study aimed to determine the test-retest reliability of a test battery of vascular function measures: automated blood pressure (BP), laser Doppler imaging with iontophoresis (LDI), digital volume pulse (DVP), pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AIx) measured by pulse wave analysis (PWA) and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) taken within and between sessions. Measures were taken in 21 non-smoking males intra-session and again inter-session (one week apart) to determine repeatability and reproducibility, respectively. There was moderate to excellent repeatability (ICC: 0.53-0.93; CV=2.2-18.1%) and reproducibility (ICC: 0.71-0.96; CV 1.9-14.2%) for BP, DVP stiffness index, PWV, AIx, AIx normalised to heart rate (75 bpm), absolute and percentage FMD. Repeatability of the DVP reflection index was moderate (ICC: 0.64; CV=9.5%) but there was poor reproducibility (ICC: 0.17; CV=15.1%). Moreover, the repeatability and reproducibility of the LDI measures ranged from poor to good (ICC: 0.31-0.84; CV=28.4-36.7%). These data indicated that there was considerable variability in the repeatability and reproducibility of measurements of endothelial function and arterial stiffness taken in a battery of measurements, which needs careful consideration in future research designs.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31307097	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307097	smoking	-1101361754763388054

HIV and methamphetamine (MA) use disorder are commonly comorbid and individually-associated with adverse health consequences, including frailty; however, less is known about the combined effects of both conditions. The current cross-sectional study examined how HIV and lifetime MA use disorder relate to frailty, and explored associations between frailty and relevant clinical outcomes (i.e., neurocognitive and everyday functioning). Participants were categorized into three groups based on HIV status and lifetime MA diagnosis: HIV+/MA+ (n=43), HIV+/MA- (n=75), and HIV-/MA- (n=92). A frailty index score (representing proportion of accumulated multisystem deficits) was calculated from 27 medical and psychiatric deficits. Multiple regression was used to examine frailty index score by HIV/MA group. Additional multiple regression models examined the interaction between frailty and HIV/MA group on cognitive and everyday functioning. Comorbid HIV+/MA+ participants had higher frailty index scores than both HIV-/MA- (b=-0.13, p<.001) and HIV+/MA- participants (b=-0.06, p=.007). Additional models linked higher frailty index score to worse global neurocognition (b=-17.6, p=.018) and greater likelihood of everyday functioning dependence (OR=1.56, p=.021). Although these relationships did not significantly differ by HIV/MA status, group-stratified analyses showed that associations of frailty with neurocognitive and everyday functioning were strongest among the HIV+/MA+ group. Multimodal public health interventions aimed at reducing frailty may help to decrease the likelihood of neurocognitive and everyday functioning problems. Current findings additionally lay groundwork for future longitudinal research examining whether frailty predicts onset of neurocognitive and functional decline in individuals with comorbid HIV and MA use disorder.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31303012	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303012	HIV	3380406830501456504

The purpose of our study was to examine how parental stress and coparenting relationship quality were related to dating violence perpetration and victimization among 114 Latinx adolescent mothers. We hypothesized that higher levels of parental stress and lower coparenting quality would be associated with increased dating violence perpetration and victimization. Prior to running a path analysis to test our hypotheses, we examined how frequently the Latinx adolescent mothers in our sample reported perpetrating at least one act of psychological or physical abuse against their partner in the past month. We found that 84.3% of the mothers in our study had perpetrated at least one act of violence against their partner in the past month and 74.7% reported they had been the victim of at least one act of violence by their partner in the past month. After accounting for frequency of contact with the father of their child, we found Latinx adolescent mothers were more likely to perpetrate abuse against, as well as be the victim of abuse by, their partner if they had a lower quality coparenting relationship.

Approximately 3% of the world population suffers from depression, which is one of the most common form of mental disorder. Recent findings suggest that an interaction between the nervous system and immune system might be behind the pathophysiology of various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including depression. Neuropeptides have been shown to play a major role in mediating response to stress and inducing immune activation or suppression. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is a major regulator of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis response. CRF is a stress-related neuropeptide whose dysregulation has been associated with depression. In this review, we summarized the role of CRF in the neuroimmune mechanisms of depression, and the potential therapeutic effects of Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) as well as other agents. Studying the network of CRF and immune responses will help to enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of depression. Additionally, targeting this important network may aid in developing novel treatments for this debilitating psychiatric disorder.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31312123	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312123	stress	-2405892683303291957

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is one of the major causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. Currently, no successful treatments are available for ALD. The pathogenesis of ALD is characterized as simple steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis (AH), and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular catabolic process, which aims at recycling cellular components and removing damaged organelles in response to starvation and stresses. Therefore, autophagy is considered as an important cellular adaptive and survival mechanism under various pathophysiological conditions. Recent studies from our lab and others suggest that chronic alcohol consumption may impair autophagy and contribute to the pathogenesis of ALD. In this chapter, we summarize recent progress on the role and mechanisms of autophagy in the development of ALD. Understanding the roles of autophagy in ALD may offer novel therapeutic avenues against ALD by targeting these pathways.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31307584	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307584	Cirrhosis	3716124214746295857

Automated electrical defibrillator (AED) is critical in saving children who develop unexpected cardiac arrest (CA), but its diagnostic capacity is not fully acknowledged. Retrospective cohort study of patients with aborted sudden cardiac death (SCD) was performed. Twenty-five patients (14 males) aged 1.3 to 17.5 years who presented with CA survived with prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Eighteen patients had no prior cardiac diagnosis. Cardiac arrest occurred in 10 patients with more than moderate exercise, in 7 with light exercise, and in 8 at rest (including one during sleep). Twenty-two patients were resuscitated with AED, all of which were recognized as a shockable cardiac rhythm. Thorough investigations revealed 6 ion channelopathies (4 catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, one long QT syndrome, and one Brugada syndrome), 5 congenital heart disease (including 2 with coronary artery obstruction), 6 cardiomyopathies, 2 myocarditis, and 2 miscellaneous. Four patients had no identifiable heart disease. In 5 patients, the downloaded AED-recorded rhythm strip delineated the underlying arrhythmias and their responses to electrical shocks. Four patients who presented with generalized seizure at rest were initially managed for seizure disorder until AED recording identified lethal ventricular arrhythmias.Conclusions: AED reliably identifies the underlying lethal ventricular arrhythmias in addition to aborting SCD. What is Known: • Although infrequent in children, sudden cardiac death (SCD) is often an unexpected and tragic event. The etiology is diverse and sometimes remains unknown despite extensive investigations. • Automated external defibrillator (AED) is both therapeutic in aborting SCD and diagnostic in identifying the underlying lethal ventricular arrhythmias. However, the diagnostic aspect of AED is under-acknowledged by most medical providers. What is New: • Four of 25 patients (16%) were initially managed for possible seizure disorders until AED recording identified lethal ventricular arrhythmia. • The AED recording of the lethal arrhythmia during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should always be obtained as it plays a crucial role in the decision-making process before ICD implantation. All medical providers should become familiar with downloading cardiac rhythm strips from AED when requested.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31297625	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297625	heart+disease	-1878128207048892154
2791	2791	74	Acta neurologica Belgica	Comparison of the effect of anterior and posterior neurosurgical treatment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy: a clinical outcome.	Cervical degenerative disease is the most common cause of acquired disability in patients over the age of 50. The incidence of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is increasing with aging of the population. Surgical decompression is indicated for severe CSM. There is, however, insufficient evidence to prefer anterior over posterior surgical decompression technique for CSM. Our purpose was to identify groups of patients that would benefit from a chosen surgical approach with a better clinical outcome. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients operated for CSM between 2007 and 2011. Patients were assessed according to the Nurick grading system. Preoperative and postoperative clinical details and MR imaging were analyzed. Treatment consisted of either anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (ACDF) or laminectomy without fusion. Over a period of 4 years, 90 patients were included. The mean age of patients was 64.5 ± 1.3 years. Of 90 included patients, 42 patients were treated with ACDF and 48 with laminectomy. Mean total Nurick grade recovery rate (NGRR) was 29.6% with 31.2% in ACDF and 27.7% in laminectomy. Mid-sagittal diameter of the cervical canal measured on MRI-T2 increased significantly more with laminectomy (4.4 mm) than ACDF (2.2 mm) (p < 0.001). The presence of preoperative spasticity or quadriparesis or a multilevel compression indicated a higher recovery on the Nurick scale.

The emergence and spread of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis is of global concern. To improve the understanding of drug resistance in Mycobacteria, numerous studies have been performed to discover diagnostic markers and genetic determinants associated with resistance to anti-tuberculosis drug. However, the related information is scattered in a massive body of literature, which is inconvenient for researchers to investigate the molecular mechanism of drug resistance. Therefore, we manually collected 1707 curated associations between 73 compounds and 132 molecules (including coding genes and non-coding RNAs) in 6 mycobacterial species from 465 studies. The experimental details of molecular epidemiology and mechanism exploration research were also summarized and recorded in our work. In addition, multidrug resistance and extensively drug resistance molecules were also extracted to interpret the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for cross resistance among anti-tuberculosis drugs. Finally, we constructed an omnibus repository named MycoResistance, a user friendly interface to conveniently browse, search and download all related entries. We hope that this elaborate database will serve as a beneficial resource for mechanism explanations, precise diagnosis and effective treatment of drug-resistant mycobacterial strains.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31290951	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31290951	tuberculosis	2834072258350675251

Risky sexual behaviors are important factors driving the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Although Zambia experiences a high HIV prevalence, especially among youth, there is a dearth of information regarding risky sexual behaviors among young adults. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence and associated factors of risky sexual behaviors among college students in Lusaka, Zambia. A cross-sectional study was conducted in February 2017 among 427 college students at the University of Zambia. Participants reported their sexual behaviors, sexual attitudes, and lifestyle using self-administered questionnaires. Multinomial logistic regression models were employed to assess potential determinants of risky sexual behaviors. Among the 205 students who reported ever having sex, 148 (72.2%) engaged in risky sexual behaviors in the last 12 months. Participants who were older (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.12-1.51), engaged in low physical activity (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.05-4.84), and reported liberal sexual attitudes (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.02-3.47) were more likely to engage in any risky sexual behavior, while frequent alcohol use (OR 8.38, 95% CI 4.60-15.27) and suicide attempts (OR 6.42, 95% CI 2.03-20.29) predicted multiple risky sexual behaviors. In conclusion, this study indicates that Zambian college students' risky sexual behaviors are associated with multiple behavioral health risks. Future research should consider using a multiple-behavior change intervention.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31309429	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309429	HIV	2282385028752844581

Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted for 218,765 adults who participated in the 2008-2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Overall, commonly cited factors were associated with increased risk for suicide ideation and attempt for some racial/ethnic groups, but not for others. As one example, 12-month depression was associated with 12-month suicide attempt for A/PI, AI/AN, Latino/a, and white, but not for Black or multiracial adults. Alcohol abuse and dependence were also associated with suicide attempt for AI/AN, Black, and white respondents but not for other racial/ethnic groups. Risk factors for suicide ideation and attempt may not increase risk universally.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly patients, affecting individuals older than 60 years. It is a complex degenerative brain disease characterized by progressive cognitive impairment. AD constitutes a major global health concern. A central role for inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Despite the understanding of multiple molecular pathways in the pathophysiology of AD, novel treatment agents with a possible role in modifying the disease activity are still lacking. Our article provides a comprehensive review of various observational studies and randomized trials encompassing the use of anti-inflammatory agents in the management of AD patients and utilizes the conclusions derived therefrom to give recommendations in this regard.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31312547	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312547	Alzheimer	-5314778455998444995

Several next-generation (universal) influenza vaccines and broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are in clinical development. Some of these mediate inhibitions of virus replication at the postentry stage or use Fc-dependent mechanisms. Nonneutralizing antibodies have the potential to mediate enhancement of viral infection or disease. In the current study, two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 72/8 and 69/1, enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) in mice following H3N2 virus challenge by demonstrating increased lung pathology and changes in lung cytokine/chemokine levels. MAb 78/2 caused changes in the lung viral loads in a dose-dependent manner. Both MAbs increased HA sensitivity to trypsin cleavage at a higher pH range, suggesting MAb-induced conformational changes. pHrodo-labeled virus particles' entry and residence time in the endocytic compartment were tracked during infection of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Both MAbs reduced H3N2 virus residence time in the endocytic pathway, suggesting faster virus fusion kinetics. Structurally, 78/2 and 69/1 Fabs bound the globular head or base of the head domain of influenza hemagglutinin (HA), respectively, and induced destabilization of the HA stem domain. Together, this study describes Mab-induced destabilization of the influenza HA stem domain, faster kinetics of influenza virus fusion, and ERD in vivo. The in vivo animal model and in vitro assays described could augment preclinical safety evaluation of antibodies and next-generation influenza vaccines that generate antibodies which do not block influenza virus-receptor interaction.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31296560	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296560	vaccine	-72844094766108869

2826	2826	402	 	Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Signaling: Roles in Neuroprotection	Glutamate neurotoxicity is involved in various neurodegenerative disorders including brain ischemic stroke, trauma, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. In addition to excitatory neuronal death, neuroinflammation accompanied by the activation of glial cells has been shown to be induced by these disorders. We previously reported the roles of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the survival of central nervous system neurons during excitotoxic events and neuroinflammation. Nicotine and other nAChR agonists protected cortical neurons against glutamate neurotoxicity via α4- and α7-nAChRs in cultures of neurons obtained from the cerebral cortex of fetal rats. In addition, donepezil, a therapeutic acetylcholinesterase inhibitor currently being used for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, protected neuronal cells from glutamate neurotoxicity. Moreover, nicotine and donepezil induced the upregulation of nAChRs. Thus, we propose that nicotine as well as donepezil prevents glutamate neurotoxicity through Α4- and α7-nAChRs and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. In addition to the beneficial effect on neuronal cells, we have reported the responses of astrocytes to bradykinin, an inflammatory mediator, and the effect of nAChR stimulation on these responses using cultured cortical astrocytes. Bradykinin induced a transient increase of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca	2019	eng	Review	 	31314407	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314407	stroke	1580124381109623727

The effects of vaccine strains pSV-less Typhimurium OU5048 and Choleraesuis OU7266 and SPI-2-mutant Choleraesuis SC2284 on the immune responses of pigs against Typhimurium, Choleraesuis, and S. Enteritidis (Enteritidis) with or without the virulence plasmid (pSV) were determined. After oral vaccination of three vaccine groups and challenge with Choleraesuis CN36, the level of Salmonella-specific IgG in sera and the bactericidal effects and superoxide generation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) against the above strains were determined using ELISA and NBT assay, respectively. Among three vaccine strains tested, OU7266 stimulated the highest Salmonella-specific IgG levels. Complement inactivation increased IgG concentration, while E. coli absorption reduced IgG levels. The pSV-containing strains were less resistant to serum killing than the pSV-less strains, and Enteritidis exhibited the lowest resistance to serum killing. Serovars tested, vaccine strains, and timeline periods postvaccination and challenge were important factors affecting superoxide production. The two Choleraesuis vaccine strains stimulated greater levels of superoxide from PMNs and PBMCs than the Typhimurium strains. The PMNs and PBMCs in challenged and vaccinated pigs reduced more superoxide than those in challenged hosts. In vaccinated hosts, pSV-less Salmonella strains triggered lower levels of PMN/PBMC-generated superoxide upon challenge than strains with pSV against Enteritidis and Choleraesuis. Overall, Choleraesuis OU7266 may be better than the other vaccine strains in generating the greatest IgG levels, serum bactericidal activity and superoxide levels. The pSV likely influences the immune responses.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31300124	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300124	vaccine	4644184613269860655

Autophagy defects are implicated in multiple late-onset neurodegenerative diseases including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases. Since aging is the most common shared risk factor in neurodegeneration, we assessed rates of autophagy in mammalian neurons during aging. We identified a significant decrease in the rate of constitutive autophagosome biogenesis during aging and observed pronounced morphological defects in autophagosomes in neurons from aged mice. While early stages of autophagosome formation were unaffected, we detected the frequent production of stalled LC3B-negative isolation membranes in neurons from aged mice. These stalled structures recruited the majority of the autophagy machinery, but failed to develop into LC3B-positive autophagosomes. Importantly, ectopically expressing WIPI2B effectively restored autophagosome biogenesis in aged neurons. This rescue is dependent on the phosphorylation state of WIPI2B at the isolation membrane, suggesting a novel therapeutic target in age-associated neurodegeneration.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31309927	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309927	aging	2050138727387005412

To examine the efficacy and safety of once-daily insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) or once-daily second-generation basal insulin analogs (insulin degludec and insulin glargine 300 units/mL) in insulin-naïve Japanese adults with type 2 diabetes in routine clinical practice. A 12-week multicenter, open-label, randomized, pilot study was performed in 52 subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Subjects were randomized to once-daily IDegAsp (n = 26) or basal insulin (n = 26). The primary endpoint was percent change in HbA1c from baseline to week 12. Furthermore, it was analyzed post hoc in subgroups stratified by baseline HbA1c. During a follow-up period, percent change in HbA1c was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.161). Daily insulin doses and frequency of overall hypoglycemia were also similar in the two groups. In post hoc analyses, once-daily basal insulin was more effective than IDegAsp in subjects with HbA1c more than or equal to 8.5% (p < 0.05); however, in subjects with HbA1c less than 8.5%, once-daily IDegAsp showed a significant improvement in percent change in HbA1c at week 12, compared with basal insulin (p < 0.01). Although there was no apparent difference in the HbA1c-lowering effects between two groups, when compared in subjects with HbA1c less than 8.5%, once-daily IDegAsp showed a significant effect in comparison with once-daily basal insulin. These findings suggest that the baseline HbA1c level might provide the important information for choosing IDegAsp or basal insulin in patients insufficiently controlled with OADs. This trial was registered with UMIN (no. UMIN000035431).	2019	eng	Journal Article	Japan	31308304	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308304	diabetes	2438237966002226084

2833	2833	589	Medicine	Role of ascitic prostaglandin E2 in diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and prediction of in-hospital mortality in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.	Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is one of the most frequent and severe complications in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Early antibiotic therapy is extremely important for successful treatment and reducing mortality. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a regulator of the immune response and infection. This study aimed to explore whether ascitic PGE2 could be used as a marker for diagnosing SBP and predicting in-hospital mortality.Patients with cirrhosis and ascites undergoing abdominal paracentesis were enrolled in our study. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters were recorded at the time of paracentesis and ascitic PGE2 levels were determined by ELISA. The correlation between ascitic PGE2 level and SBP as well as in-hospital mortality were analyzed.There were 224 patients enrolled, 29 (13%) patients diagnosed as SBP based on the current guideline criteria. The ascitic PGE2 level of patients with SBP [32.77 (26.5-39.68) pg/mL] was significantly lower than that of patients without SBP [49.72 (37.35-54.72) pg/mL]. In ROC analysis, the AUC of ascitic PGE2 for the diagnosis of SBP was 0.75, and the AUC of ascitic PGE2 combined with WBC and ascitic PGE2 combined with neutrophils were 0.90 and 0.90, respectively, which were significantly higher than that of ascitic PGE2. In multivariate analysis, ascites PGE2≤32.88 pg/mL (OR: 9.39; 95% CI: 1.41-67.44, P = .026), hepatic encephalopathy (OR: 18.39; 95% CI: 3.00-113.13, P = .002) and a higher MELD score (OR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.05-1.40, P = .009) remained independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.Ascitic PGE2 level is likely to be a valuable marker in prediction of in-hospital mortality in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and its value in diagnosis of SBP was not superior to other inflammatory indicators.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31261505	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31261505	Cirrhosis	9026402401132606773

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) adversely affects neurological recovery. This study aimed to determine the impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and/or rehabilitation in basal ganglia stroke patients with OSA.A prospective controlled trial was conducted in 2015-2018. The subjects received routine rehabilitation training for up to 2 years and were assigned to the intervention and control groups treated with CPAP or without, respectively. Then, treatment effects on sleep parameters, motor function, stroke severity, daily life activities, cognitive function, and psychological states were assessed at different time points.At 6 months, the CPAP group showed significantly lower mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), percentage of time with SpO2 at <90% (TS90%), micro-arousal index, and percentages of time in non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) stages 1-2 and REM stage in total sleeping time compared with the control group, and significantly higher mean minimum of peripheral oxygen saturation (L-SaO2%) and percentage of time in stage 3 (P < .001) sleep.

Asthma incidence and severity are increased in obese populations. Systematic reviews have shown benefit from weight-loss interventions on asthma outcomes, but the role of bariatric surgery is still unclear. In this review, cohorts of obese asthmatic patients undergoing bariatric surgery were examined regarding different asthma outcomes. The available data on patients who were followed up showed improvements in asthma control, exacerbation risk, asthma-related hospitalisation, medication use and airway hyperresponsiveness, with some patients not requiring further treatment for asthma. Follow-up duration was variable, being mostly of 1 year, with some studies reporting long-term outcomes after 5 years. The studies reviewed had many limitations, including small numbers of patients, lack of control arm in some studies and lack of standardisation of asthma diagnosis, classification and outcome measures, in addition to possible reporting bias. Data on small numbers of patients also show the possibility of benefit exclusively in nonallergic asthma. Larger, more stringent clinical trials are needed before recommending bariatric surgery for treatment of asthma.	2019	eng	Review	England	31285286	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285286	asthma	-1572252285162838958

The oral triiodothyronine for infants and children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (OTICC) trial showed that Triiodothyronine (T3) supplementation improved hemodynamic and clinical outcome parameters. We tested the validity of low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), derived using clinical parameters and laboratory data, by comparing the LCOS diagnosis with objective parameters commonly measured in a cardiac intensive care unit (CCU) setting. OTICC, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial included children younger than 3 years with an Aristotle score between 6 and 9. We used the existing trial data set to compare the LCOS diagnosis with echocardiographic hemodynamic parameters. Additionally, we determined if LCOS, prospectively assigned during a clinical trial, served as an early predictor of clinical outcomes. All LCOS subjects at 6 and 12 h after cross-clamp release later showed significantly lower pulse pressure, stroke volume and cardiac output, and higher systemic vascular resistance. These LCOS patients also had significantly longer time to extubation (TTE) and higher mortality rate. LCOS incidence was significantly lower in the T3 treatment group [n = 86 vs. 66, respectively, p < 0.001; OR (95% CI) 0.43 (0.36-0.52)] particularly at 6 h. Also, LCOS patients in the placebo group had significantly lower FT3 serum levels over time. These analyses confirm that early clinically defined LCOS successfully predicts cardiac dysfunction determined later by objective hemodynamic echocardiographic parameters. Furthermore, early LCOS significantly impacts TTE and mortality. Finally, the data support prior clinical trial data, showing that oral T3 supplementation decreases early LCOS in concordance with reducing TTE.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31309235	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309235	stroke	-7108012586837980940

To evaluate the distribution of complications of chronic otitis media, dilemma of how soon to operate a seriously ill patient with CSOM and treatment outcomes. A retrospective study was done in a tertiary care centre. Clinical data from 2013 to 2015 was compiled, surgical management with outcome was analysed. A total of 425 patients with chronic otitis media were evaluated. Single/multiple complications were seen in 147 (34.5%) patients. Majority of the complications were seen in active squamosal type of chronic otitis media i.e. 137 (59.5%) cases out of the 147. Meningitis (3.3%) was the most common intracranial complication. Patients with intracranial complications were referred from other departments and did not primarily present to ENT, indicating a major fact that treatment was sort for the complication and not for chronic otitis media. Headache with or without ear discharge was the most common presenting complaint. Fever and pain were not prominent indicators of complications, posing a diagnostic dilemma as patients were already receiving antibiotics and analgesics before reaching tertiary care centre. The patients with severe intracranial complications were promptly taken up (within 3-5 days) for canal wall down mastoidectomy with intravenous broad spectrum antibiotic (vancomycin) and mannitol with high risk consent. However ill the patients were, especially children with very poor general conditions, there was dramatic recovery as soon as the mastoidectomy was done. There were no deaths due to the complications of chronic otitis media in our 3 years study period. Delay in resorting to surgical management of chronic otitis media was the main reason for patients going into complications. Timely mastoidectomy in patients with poor general condition with high risk of mortality, the surgery actually had a major role in reducing the morbidity and mortality. Lack of awareness that chronic otitis media is a condition that can lead to life threatening complications resulted in procrastination of surgery. Chronic otitis media requires speedy surgical management i.e. as soon as patient is fit to tolerate anaesthesia: Tympanoplasty and Canal wall up or down Mastoidectomy to prevent complications from arising or to resolve the present complication.	2019	eng	Journal Article	India	31275822	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31275822	headache	215332765550420709
2843	2843	218	Journal of biomechanical engineering	A Computational Study on Deformed Bioprosthetic Valve Geometries: Clinically Relevant Valve Performance Metrics.	Transcatheter aortic valves (TAV) are symmetrically designed, but they are often not deployed inside cylindrical conduits with circular cross-sectional areas. Many TAV patients have heavily calcified aortic valves, which often result in deformed prosthesis geometries after deployment. We investigated the effects of deformed valve annulus configurations on a surgical bioprosthetic valve as a model for TAV. We studied valve leaflet motions, stresses and strains, and analogue hydrodynamic measures (using geometric methods), via finite element modeling. Two categories of annular deformations were created to approximate clinical observations: 1) non-circular annulus with valve area conserved, and 2) under-expansion (reduced area) compared to circular annulus. We found that under-expansion had more impact on increasing stenosis than non-circularity, and that non-circularity had more impact on increasing regurgitation than under-expansion. We found durability predictors (stress/strain) to be highest in commissure regions of non-circular configurations. This study adds more evidence for considering the clinical impacts of TAV deformation on acute and long-term valve performance in the design and testing phase of device development.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31314893	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314893	stress	8057379878708189245

Guidelines recommend oral anticoagulant (OAC) monotherapy without antiplatelet therapy (APT) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) of >1 year after myocardial infarction or percutaneous coronary intervention. More evidences are required for the safety and efficacy of OAC monotherapy compared with OAC plus APT. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched up to February 2019. Nonrandomized studies and randomized clinical trials comparing OAC monotherapy with OAC plus single APT (SAPT) for patients with stable CAD and nonvalvular AF. The primary end point was major adverse cardiovascular events (composite of ischemic or thrombotic events) and secondary outcomes included major bleeding, stroke, all-cause death, and net adverse events (composite of ischemic, thrombotic, or bleeding events). From 6 trials, 8,855 patients were included. There was no significant difference in major adverse cardiovascular event in patients with AF treated using OAC plus SAPT compared with those treated with OAC monotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92 to 1.29). OAC plus SAPT was associated with a significantly higher risk of major bleeding compared with OAC monotherapy (HR 1.61; 95% CI 1.38 to 1.87), as well as in terms of net adverse event (HR 1.21; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.43). There were no significant differences in rates of stroke and all-cause death. In conclusion, in this meta-analysis, OAC monotherapy and OAC plus SAPT treatment showed similar effectiveness, but OAC monotherapy was significantly associated with a lower risk of bleeding compared with OAC plus SAPT in patients with nonvalvular AF and stable CAD.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31311662	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311662	stroke	2930191803881821526

On June 4, 2016, the Prey Veng Provincial Health Department reported a total of 107 patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) from Chakhlanh village to the Cambodian Ministry of Health. To confirm the outbreak and evaluate its clinical and epidemiological characteristics, the investigation team visited the village and reviewed the case-based surveillance (CBS) data on severe respiratory infection (SRI) and patients' records in health facilities. The team interviewed all households in the village from May 1 to June 5, 2016 and obtained the following data: age, medical history, date of onset, treatment, symptoms, and history of contact with patients or dead poultry. Nasal swab samples were collected from suspected ILI cases to test for influenza virus by RT-PCR. The investigation detected 498 suspected ILI cases, including 288 females. Although the incidence of suspected ILI cases who visited health centers was 63.0 per 1,000 persons per month, the attack rate was 27.1 per 100 population. The major age group was 5-14 years followed by 0-4 years. Major symptoms were cough, fever, runny nose, and headache. Six of seven nasal swab samples were positive for influenza A/H1N1 pdm09 virus. Most children with flu symptoms had contact with previous cases. This study showed that the ILI outbreak might be caused by seasonal influenza A/H1N1 pdm09 spread from person to person. Poor living conditions and poor hygiene and sanitation practices were environmental factors that caused the outbreak. As the CBS system was unable to identify this epidemic, it needs to be improved.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Japan	31241062	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31241062	flu	428486625959995206

Tight junction proteins are important for the maintenance and repair of the intestinal mucosal barrier. The present study investigated relationships among tight junction protein gene expression, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection, and intestinal mucosal morphology in piglets. We compared the expression of six tight junction proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2, Occludin, Claudin-1, Claudin-4, and Claudin-5) between seven-day-old piglets infected with PEDV and normal piglets, as well as in PEDV-infected porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). We also evaluated differences in mucosal morphology between PEDV-infected and normal piglets. The expression of six tight junction protein genes was lower in PEDV-infected piglets than in the normal animals. The expression of ZO-1, ZO-2, Occludin, and Claudin-4 in the intestine tissue was significantly lower (p⟨0.05) in PEDV-infected than in normal piglets. The expression of Claudin-5 in the jejunum was significantly lower in PEDV-infected piglets than in the normal animals (p⟨0.01). The expression of Claudin-1 and Claudin-5 genes in the ileum was significantly higher in PEDV-infected piglets than in normal piglets (p⟨0.01). Morphologically, the intestinal mucosa in PEDV-infected piglets exhibited clear pathological changes, including breakage and shedding of intestinal villi. In PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells, the mRNA expression of the six tight junction proteins showed a downward trend; in particular, the expression of the Occludin and Claudin-4 genes was significantly lower (p⟨0.01). These data suggest that the expression of these six tight junction proteins, especially Occludin and Claudin-4, plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier and resistance to PEDV infection in piglets.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31269354	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31269354	Diarrhea	-8934199835393138432

Control of testicular development is multifactorial and involves a number of hypothalamic, hypophyseal and peripheral hormones. Here, we investigated direct action of zebrafish gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (zGnih) which is expressed in the testis, on spermatogenesis in zebrafish, in vitro. Treatment with zGnih at the lower doses (10 and 100 nM) inhibited gonadotropin-induced spermatids/spermatozoa (SPD/SPZ) production. However, at the highest dose (1000 nM), zGnih increased basal number of SPD/SPZ and showed paradoxical effect. The effects of zGnih on testosterone and SPD/SPZ production was blocked in the presence of androgen receptor antagonist, flutamide (FLU). A number of transcripts were also measured to better understand zGnih mechanisms of action on zebrafish spermatogenesis. Our results provide strong support for the hypothesis that locally produced zGnih is a component of the complex multifactorial system that regulates testicular development and function in adult zebrafish, in part, by changes in testicular steroidogenesis and regulation of gonadotropin-induced response.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Ireland	31048005	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048005	flu	-7525512143002603676

Our previous finding demonstrated that chronic corticosterone (CORT) may be involved in mediating the pathophysiology of premature aging in rats. Frequent jet lag increases the risk for many diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, and is associated with the aging processes. However, the effect of jet lag on CORT-induced depression and its association with aging phenotypes remain unclear. In this study, the rats were exposed to both CORT and jet lag treatment, and the differences were analyzed and compared to rats with single CORT treatment. Our results showed that jet lag treatment aggravated CORT-induced depression-like behavior evidenced by sucrose intake test, forced swimming test, and open field test. Additionally, this treatment aggravated the shortening of telomeres, which possibly resulted in decreased telomerase activity, and downregulated the expression of telomere-binding factor 2 (TRF2) and telomerase reverse transcriptase compared to that in CORT rats, as revealed by quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. The shortening of telomeres may have been caused by increased oxidative stress, which was associated with the inhibition of sirtuin 3. Exposure to jet lag also aggravated the degeneration of mitochondrial functions, as shown by the decreases in the mRNA expression of COX1, ND1, and Tfam. Our findings provide physiological evidence that jet lag exposure may worsen stress-induced depression and age-related abnormalities.	2019	eng	Journal Article	China	31314053	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314053	stress	4891010769166501207

The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Vibrio cholerae O139, strain CIRS245, was isolated conventionally, and the lipid A was removed by mild acid hydrolysis (0.1 M NaOAc buffer containing 1% SDS, pH 4.2, 95°C, 8 h). The crude product was a complex mixture consisting mainly of constituent fragments of the O-specific polysaccharide-core (OSPc). The OSPc was only a minor component in the mixture. Two-stage purification of the crude OSPc by HPLC gave pure OSPc fragment of the LPS, as shown by NMR spectroscopy, analytical HPLC and ESI-MS. This material is the purest OSPc fragment of the LPS from Vibrio cholerae O139 reported to date. The purified OSPc was readily converted to the corresponding methyl squarate derivative and the latter was conjugated to BSA. The conjugate, when examined by ELISA, showed immunoreactivity with sera from patients in Bangladesh recovering from cholera caused by V. cholerae O139, but not O1.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Germany	31306528	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306528	vaccine	7526977287801930517

We introduce a computational model for the cellular level effects of firing rate filtering due to the major forms of neuronal injury, including demyelination and axonal swellings. Based upon experimental and computational observations, we posit simple phenomenological input/output rules describing spike train distortions and demonstrate that slow-gamma frequencies in the 38-41 Hz range emerge as the most robust to injury. Our signal-processing model allows us to derive firing rate filters at the cellular level for impaired neural activity with minimal assumptions. Specifically, we model eight experimentally observed spike train transformations by discrete-time filters, including those associated with increasing refractoriness and intermittent blockage. Continuous counterparts for the filters are also obtained by approximating neuronal firing rates from spike trains convolved with causal and Gaussian kernels. The proposed signal processing framework, which is robust to model parameter calibration, is an abstraction of the major cellular-level pathologies associated with neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic brain injuries that affect spike train propagation and impair neuronal network functionality. Our filters are well aligned with the spectrum of dynamic memory fields including working memory, visual consciousness, and other higher cognitive functions that operate in a frequency band that is - at a single cell level - optimally guarded against common types of pathological effects. In contrast, higher-frequency neural encoding, such as is observed with short-term memory, are susceptible to neurodegeneration and injury.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31165337	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31165337	Alzheimer	1220948775534529013

The lack of a univocal definition of frailty, a condition frequently found in the elderly population which is correlated with an increased risk of mortality, has prompted the search for clinical and laboratory parameters associated with this condition. Whereas OPG is a protein involved in different pathophysiological conditions including bone, vascular, immune and tumor disease and studies found a positive linear correlation between OPG and age we hypothesized that it may represent a frailty marker in the elderly.We conducted an observational study of 172 elderly subjects, with and without hip fracture, including a multidimensional geriatric evaluation and a laboratory evaluation, aimed to evaluate the association between OPG and frailty.Frailty Score was associated with FT3 and osteoprotegerin (OPG), regardless of fracture event. Excluding subjects with hip fracture, in whom the acute event had a direct effect on bone production of OPG, the Frailty Score showed a linear correlation with circulating levels of osteoprotegerin.In the elderly, an increase in osteoprotegerin levels may reflect a progressive accumulation of organ damage leading to the development of frailty. The correlation between OPG and Frailty Score found in our study points to its potential use as a biomarker for geriatric frailty syndrome.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31311890	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311890	aging	363303724138208407

Antiretroviral agents with long-acting properties have potential to improve treatment outcomes substantially for people living with HIV. In November 2017, the Long acting/Extended Release Antiretroviral Resource Program (LEAP) convened a workshop with the aim of shaping the research agenda and promoting early development of long-acting or extended release products for key populations: pregnant and lactating women, children aged up to 10 years, and adolescents aged 10-19 years. Goals included strategies and principles to ensure that the needs of children, adolescents, and pregnant and lactating women are considered when developing long-acting formulations. Research should focus not only on how best to transition long-acting products to these populations, but also on early engagement across sectors and among stakeholders. A parallel rather than sequential approach is needed when establishing adult, adolescent, and paediatric clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval. Pregnant and lactating women should be included in adult clinical trials. Adolescent-friendly trial design is needed to improve recruitment and retention of young people.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31307946	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307946	HIV	-5924653357616257702
2870	2870	266	PLoS pathogens	Similarities and differences between native HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein trimers and stabilized soluble trimer mimetics.	The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer is located on the surface of the virus and is the target of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Recombinant native-like soluble Env trimer mimetics, such as SOSIP trimers, have taken a central role in HIV-1 vaccine research aimed at inducing bNAbs. We therefore performed a direct and thorough comparison of a full-length unmodified Env trimer containing the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail, with the sequence matched soluble SOSIP trimer, both based on an early Env sequence (AMC011) from an HIV+ individual that developed bNAbs. The structures of the full-length AMC011 trimer bound to either bNAb PGT145 or PGT151 were very similar to the structures of SOSIP trimers. Antigenically, the full-length and SOSIP trimers were comparable, but in contrast to the full-length trimer, the SOSIP trimer did not bind at all to non-neutralizing antibodies, most likely as a consequence of the intrinsic stabilization of the SOSIP trimer. Furthermore, the glycan composition of full-length and SOSIP trimers was similar overall, but the SOSIP trimer possessed slightly less complex and less extensively processed glycans, which may relate to the intrinsic stabilization as well as the absence of the membrane tether. These data provide insights into how to best use and improve membrane-associated full-length and soluble SOSIP HIV-1 Env trimers as immunogens.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31306470	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306470	vaccine	-1668558678125613329

Most very small renal masses cannot be characterized due to their size. Because the overwhelming majority of these are benign, follow-up is suggested only when these masses appear heterogeneous. CT and MRI are able to predict which cystic renal masses are most likely to be malignant. CT and MRI can identify macroscopic fat in the vast majority of angiomyolipomas, allowing for differentiation from other solid renal masses. Although some solid renal masses without macroscopic fat may contain distinct combinations of imaging features, there is much overlap, and biopsy will often be required for diagnosis. CT and MRI are accurate in staging renal cancers, predicting whether partial nephrectomy can be performed successfully, and for imaging patients after treatment. Unique patterns of metastatic disease response can be encountered after treatment of metastatic renal cancer with targeted chemotherapeutic agents. Radiologists must be aware of these patterns as well as of the imaging appearance of newly emerging treatment complications.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314380	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314380	cancer	5930806521893160184

2877	2877	95	The Analyst	Colorimetric and fluorescent dual-mode detection of microRNA based on duplex-specific nuclease assisted gold nanoparticle amplification.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are attractive candidates for biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis, and play vital roles in physiological and pathological processes. In this work, we developed a colorimetric and fluorescent dual-mode sensor for miRNA detection based on the optical properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and the duplex-specific nuclease (DSN)-assisted signal amplification technique. In brief, FAM labelled hairpin probes (HPs) were immobilized on AuNPs, and fluorescence was efficiently quenched by the vicinity of the fluorophores to the AuNPs surface. In the presence of target miRNAs, the HPs could specifically hybridize with miRNAs and the DNA strand in the DNA/RNA heteroduplexes could be subsequently hydrolyzed by DSN. As a result, numbers of fluorophores were released into the solution, resulting in obvious fluorescence signal recovery. Meanwhile, the target miRNAs were able to participate in other hybridization reactions. With the DSN-assisted signal amplification technique, lots of gold nanoparticles were produced with short-chain DNA on their surface, which could aggregate in salt solution and result in a colorimetric detection. The proposed dual-mode strategy offers a sensitive, accurate and selective detection method for miRNAs. One reason is that the stem of the HPs was elaborately designed to avoid hydrolyzation by DSN under optimal conditions, which ensures a relatively low background and high sensitivity. The other is that the dual-mode strategy is more beneficial for enhancing the accuracy and reproducibility of the measurements. Moreover, the unique selective-cutting ability and single-base mismatch differentiation capability of the DSN also give rise to a satisfactory selectivity. This demonstrated that the developed method could quantitatively detect miR-21 down to 50 pM with a linear calibration range from 50 pM to 1 nM, and the analytical assay of target miRNAs in cell lysate samples revealed its great potential for application in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31313769	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313769	cancer	3086800924266336392

An overview of phenotypic analogues of human cognitive and behavioral impairments, with an emphasis on those relevant to psychosis, in AD-related mouse models is provided, followed by an update on recent progress in efforts to translate findings in the pathophysiology of psychotic AD into novel models.

This year marks the 15th anniversary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Canada and the 100th anniversary of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. These, and other recent public health events, provide an opportunity for us to review and reflect on the evolution of Canada's public health emergency response over the past 15 years-from SARS, to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, to Ebola virus and Zika virus disease. Key lessons have been learned and milestones achieved that have shaped and sharpened our response approach and structures. While SARS was a wake-up-call to strengthen infection prevention and control capacity in health care settings and led to the formation of the Public Health Agency of Canada, it also strengthened our Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) senior-level governance and led to agreements for pan-Canadian mutual aid and infectious disease information sharing. As well, our collective public health laboratory capacity has been strengthened through ongoing response and sharing of advanced diagnostics and research. As we move forward, it will be important to explore the design of scalable or modular emergency response strategies and structures that are socio-culturally appropriate and employ evidence-based strategic risk communications that continue to be critical, especially given the volume and spread of misinformation. With the current global reality, we must recognize that public health threats that go unchecked anywhere in the world have the potential to very rapidly become a public health threat in Canada. We need to build, maintain and share our best public health practices globally, for we neglect these at our peril.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Canada	31007618	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007618	flu	6097677219931837830

"This review investigates about the role of Staphylococcus Aureus (S. aureus) and S. aureus enterotoxins (SEs) in the pathogenesis of several chronic airway diseases. S. aureus is part of normal human flora and may colonize the skin and the upper airways. SEs acting as superantigens can induce an intense T cell activation and through the release of interleukin (IL) - 4, 5, and 13, can promote a polyclonal IgE response and eosinophilic inflammation.

The optimum treatment strategy for neuroretinitis due to Bartonella henselae in immunocompetent individuals is not clear and a matter of debate. The role of systemic corticosteroids in infectious neuroretinitis and the optimum immunosuppressive regimen for use in recurrent idiopathic neuroretinitis also remains ill defined. There is no class 1 evidence to support a specific treatment strategy for neuroretinitis. For uncomplicated B. henselae-associated neuroretinitis in immunocompetent patients, initiation of antibiotic and corticosteroid therapy remains controversial. In patients with severe vision loss and/or moderate to severe systemic symptoms, a 4- to 6-week regimen of doxycycline or azithromycin with rifampin may provide some benefit. The routine use of systemic corticosteroids in infectious neuroretinitis is not recommended. Targeted antimicrobial agents should be instituted in cases of neuroretinitis due to specific infectious etiologies (e.g., syphilis, Lyme disease, tuberculosis). Azathioprine may be beneficial in cases of recurrent idiopathic neuroretinitis. There is a need for collaborative, multicenter prospective studies to provide definitive guidelines regarding the use of antibiotics and corticosteroids and to evaluate future therapies in infectious and recurrent idiopathic neuroretinitis.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31278547	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31278547	tuberculosis	3704349024245704692

Vaccine-induced immunity declines with age, which may differ between males and females. Using human sera collected before and 21 days after receipt of the monovalent A/Cal/09 H1N1 vaccine, we evaluated cytokine and antibody responses in adult (18-45 years) and aged (65+ years) individuals. After vaccination, adult females developed greater IL-6 and antibody responses than either adult males or aged females, with female antibody responses being positively associated with concentrations of estradiol. To test whether protection against influenza virus challenge was greater in females than males, we primed and boosted adult (8-10 weeks) and aged (68-70 weeks) male and female mice with an inactivated A/Cal/09 H1N1 vaccine or no vaccine and challenged with a drift variant A/Cal/09 virus. As compared with unvaccinated mice, vaccinated adult, but not aged, mice experienced less morbidity and better pulmonary viral clearance following challenge, regardless of sex. Vaccinated adult female mice developed antibody responses that were of greater quantity and quality and more protective than vaccinated adult males. Sex differences in vaccine efficacy diminished with age in mice. To determine the role of sex steroids in vaccine-induced immune responses, adult mice were gonadectomized and hormones (estradiol in females and testosterone in males) were replaced in subsets of animals before vaccination. Vaccine-induced antibody responses were increased in females by estradiol and decreased in males by testosterone. The benefit of elevated estradiol on antibody responses and protection against influenza in females is diminished with age in both mice and humans.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31312529	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312529	vaccine	6236312923258954569

Cancer research has advanced throughout the years with respect to the personalization of the treatments and to targeting cancer-related molecular signatures on different organs. Still, the adverse events of the treatments such as radiotherapy are of high concern as they may increase the mortality rate due to their severity. With the improved efficiency of cancer treatments, patient survival has been increasing. Consequently, the number of patients with adverse effects from radiotherapy is also expected to increase in the forthcoming years. Therefore, approaches for personalized treatments include the elimination of adverse events and decreasing the toxicity in healthy tissues while increasing the efficiency of cancer cytotoxicity. In this context, this paper aims to discuss the recent advances in the field of thorax irradiation therapy and its related toxicities leading to radiation pneumonitis in cancer patients. Molecular mechanisms involved in the radiation-induced lung injury and approaches used to overcome this lung injury are discussed. The discourse covers approaches such as therapeutic administration of natural products, current and prospective radioprotective drugs, and applications of mesenchymal stem cells for radiation-induced lung injury.	2019	eng	Review	Italy	31313081	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313081	cancer	3091351089612339864
2903	2903	590	Epidemiologia e prevenzione	[SENTIERI: Epidemiological Study of Residents in National Priority Contaminated Sites. Fifth Report].	The main findings of SENTIERI Project have been the detection of excesses for the diseases which showed an a priori epidemiological evidence of a causal association with the environmental exposures specific for each considered NPCS. These observations are valuable within public health, because they contribute to priority health promotion activities. Looking ahead, the health benefits of an improved environmental quality might be appreciated in terms of reduction of the occurrence of adverse health effects attributable to each Site major pollutant agents. Due to the methodological approach of the present study, it was not possible to adjust for several confounding factors reported to be risk factors for the studied diseases (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity). Even if excesses of mortality, hospitalization, cancer incidence, and prevalence of congenital anomalies were found in several NPCSs, the study design and the multifactorial aetiology of the considered diseases do not permit, for all of them, to draw conclusions in terms of causal links with environmental contamination. Moreover, it must be taken into consideration that economic factors and the availability of health services may also play a relevant role in a diseases outcome. A few observations regarding some methodological limitations of SENTIERI Project should be made. There is not a uniform environmental characterisation of the studied NPCSs in term of quality and detection of the pollutants, because this information is present in different databases which at present are not adequately connected. Moreover, the recognition of a contaminated site as a National Priority Site is based on soil and groundwater pollution, and the available information on air quality is currently sparse and not homogenous. Another limitation, in term of statistical power, is the small population size of many NPCSs and the low frequency of several health outcomes. A special caution must be paid in data interpretation when considering the correspondence between the contaminated areas and the municipality boundaries, as they do not always coincide perfectly: in some cases, a small municipality with a large industrial site, while in other settings only a part of the municipality is exposed to the sources of pollution. Furthermore, all available health information systems are currently accessible at municipality level. The real breakthrough is essentially comprised of the development and fostering of a networking system involving all local health authorities and regional environmental protection agencies operating in the areas under study. The possibility to integrate the geographic approach of SENTIERI Project with a set of ad hoc analytic epidemiological investigations, such as residential cohort studies, case control studies, children health surveys, biomonitoring surveys, and with socioepidemiological studies, might greatly contribute to the identification of health priorities for environmental remediation activities. Finally, as discussed in the last section of the report, there is a need to adopt, in each NPCS, a two-way oriented communication plan involving public health authorities, scientific community, and resident population, taking into account that the history, the cultural frame and the network of relationships specific of each local context play a major role in the risk perception perspective.	2019	ita	Journal Article	Italy	31295974	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295974	smoking	-1447641181396994093

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) data have been central to the development of targeted therapy and immunotherapy for precision oncology. In targeted therapy, drugs directly attack cancer, by altering the expression of critical cancer genes identified with cancer genome profiling. Immunotherapy drugs indirectly attack cancer, by inducing the immune system to attack and treat cancer. Harnessing genomic data for deployment and development of immunotherapy comprises the field of immunogenomics. The discovery of a link between cancer cells escaping immune destruction and cancer progression, led to extensive research into this mechanism and drug development. In the past few years, FDA has granted accelerated approval to several immunotherapy cancer treatment drugs, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab, belonging to the class of checkpoint inhibitors. Utilization of pretreatment genomic cancer screening to identify patients most likely to respond to immunotherapy and to customize immunotherapy for a given patient, promises to improve cancer treatment outcomes. Recent advances in molecular profiling, high-throughput sequencing, and computational efficiency has made immunogenomics the major tenet of precision medicine in cancer treatment. This review provides a brief overview on the state of art of immunogenomics in precision cancer medicine.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31314580	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314580	cancer	-7534240757267992657

Age-associated increases in antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in the general population are commonly noted but the mechanisms underlying this observation are unclear. This study aims to evaluate whether shorter peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) telomere length, a marker of more advanced biological age, is associated with ANA positivity prevalence and incidence in middle and older aged autoimmune disease-free individuals from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Telomere length was measured by Southern Blot and categorized into tertiles. ANA was measured in a 1:80 and a 1:160 dilution of sera by immunofluorescence using HEp-2 cells (seropositive = 3 or 4). Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of ANA positivity comparing the shorter tertiles of telomere length to the longest tertile for two cross-sectional points in time and then longitudinally to assess the association between shorter telomere length and incident ANA positivity. Cross-sectional analyses were adjusted for sex, race and BMI (N = 368 baseline, N = 370 follow-up) and longitudinal analyses were adjusted for sex, race, BMI and time between baseline and follow-up (N = 246). No statistically significant cross-sectional associations were observed at baseline or follow-up. Among those where ANA negative at baseline, individuals with shorter telomeres were more likely to be ANA positive at follow-up, an average 13 years later. Individuals with short telomeres at both time periods were more likely to be ANA positive. Findings suggest that ANA positivity in the general population may be indicative of immune dysfunction resulting from advanced cellular aging processes.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31303354	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303354	aging	-3872763991286728274

Neuroinflammation underlies the etiology of multiple neurodegenerative diseases and stroke. Our understanding of neuroinflammation has evolved in the last few years and major players have been identified. Microglia, the brain resident macrophages, are considered sentinels at the forefront of the neuroinflammatory response to different brain insults. Interestingly, microglia perform other physiological functions in addition to their role in neuroinflammation. Therefore, an updated approach in which modulation, rather than complete elimination of microglia is necessary. In this review, the emerging roles of microglia and their interaction with different components of the neurovascular unit are discussed. In addition, recent data on sex differences in microglial physiology and in the context of stroke will be presented. Finally, the multiplicity of roles assumed by microglia in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke, and in the presence of co-morbidities such as hypertension and diabetes are summarized.	2019	eng	Review	Netherlands	31315064	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315064	diabetes	-5954724412982705962
2909	2909	249	Inflammation	Uremic Serum Induces Inflammation in Cultured Human Endothelial Cells and Triggers Vascular Repair Mechanisms.	Inflammation and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients whose vascular endothelium is in direct contact with the uremic toxins found in the blood. These toxins are believed to affect vascular injury and repair process, which is impaired in ESRD patients. The exact mechanisms behind these interactions are not clear. So, we wanted to investigate what happens at the molecular level of endothelial cells when exposed to uremic serum from ESRD patients with diabetes and/or hypertension and its effect on the expression of molecules associated with vascular injury and repair. Cultured human endothelial cells (ECV304) were incubated in the presence of normal or uremic sera from ESRD patients with diabetes and/or hypertension. The expressions of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) were investigated in endothelial cells (ECV304) by real-time PCR and ELISA. The expression of MCP-1, VEGF, and SDF-1 was elevated in endothelial cells upon exposure to uremic sera from ESRD patients with diabetes and/or hypertension when compared with cells treated with healthy serum. MCP-1 expression in endothelial cells treated with uremic serum from ESRD patients with hypertension only was significantly increased compared with its expression in other cohorts. Exposure of endothelial cells to uremic serum causes endothelial injury and inflammation characterized by an increase in MCP-1 expression. This injury activates the initiation of vascular repair process in these cells by increasing the expression of VEGF and SDF-1. These molecules can be important biomarkers of chronic kidney disease-associated CVD.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31312972	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312972	diabetes	7419040071212162906

This study explored the potential association between chronic exposure to pesticide mixtures including paraquat and respiratory outcomes among Colombian farmers. Sociodemographic and occupational data, respiratory symptoms and spirometric data were collected. Paraquat in spot urine samples were quantified with solid-phase extraction high-performance liquid chromatography. Multiple Poisson regressions with robust variance were used to determine factors associated with respiratory outcomes. Profiles of pesticide mixtures used were identified among 217 farmworkers, but profenofos and methamidophos-based mixtures were more frequent. Chronic paraquat exposure was slightly associated with self-reported asthma (PR: 1.06; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.13). Different pesticide mixtures were associated with flu, thoracic pain, allergic rhinitis, and obstructive pattern in spirometry. Although acute exposure to paraquat is low among Colombian farmers participating in the study, associations between respiratory outcomes and chronic pesticide mixtures exposure including profenofos, methamidophos or glyphosate require further specific studies.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Japan	30996154	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30996154	flu	3999205546352981758

A 35-year-old man presented with left eye pain and ptosis, and fever for 2 weeks. Before symptom onset, he visited Vietnam where he developed a flu-like illness; however, antibiotics were ineffective. We suspected Brucella as the most likely infectious etiology for the patient's intracavernous aneurysm. Since the aneurysm did not reduce in size following 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy, we placed a PED in the left internal carotid artery. Follow-up angiogram 4 months later showed no residual aneurysm, and cranial nerve palsies had completely resolved. From the results of this case, it appears that flow diverter stenting may be a safe and effective treatment of mycotic aneurysms of the cavernous segment of ICA.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31101401	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101401	flu	3770082505811422124

2930	2930	392	Water research	Evaluation of potential environmental benefits from seawater toilet flushing.	Water scarcity has become a global issue that has forced many communities to seek alternative water resources. The majority of water on the earth's surface comes from the sea. Seawater has the potential to mitigate water stress after proper treatment. In Hong Kong, seawater has been used directly for toilet flushing for more than 50 years and the seawater toilet flushing (SWTF) system serves 80% of the residents. However, its environmental feasibility remains unknown. This study is a pioneer evaluating the environmental performances of the SWTF system by comparing SWTF with other alternative water resources including desalinated seawater, desalinated wastewater effluent, centralized wastewater reclamation and on-site greywater reclamation systems, while the conventional long-distance imported water scenario is set as the baseline for comparison. This evaluation is first conducted in the Southern District and North New Territory in Hong Kong, demonstrating SWTF is significantly more environmentally-friendly than other alternative water resources, which is the only alternative water resource application approach with environmental impacts comparable with the conventional long-distance imported water scenario. On the contrary, other alternative water resources application approaches would result in additional environmental impacts. Seaside distances and effective population density are two major geographical impact factors effecting the environmental impacts of different water systems in these two districts. The benefits obtained from SWTF in fourteen cities in South China are further investigated. It is confirmed that SWTF can significantly relieve water stress with the lowest environmental impacts comparing with other alternative options in these cities if alternative water resources must be applied for domestic usage. However, the assessment from different aspects should be further conducted to compare these alternative water resources.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31310889	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310889	stress	7581009799961380333

The aim of this study was the assessment of the relationship between cigarette smoking and optic nerve and macular vessel density measured by optical coherence tomography angiography. We examined 30 eyes from 30 healthy habitual smokers. The examination was performed using a high-speed and high-resolution spectral-domain optical coherence tomography RTVue XR Avanti with AngioVue (Optovue, Fremont, CA, USA) with a split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography algorithm. Blood pressure, heart rate, vascular density in the area of the optic nerve head (4.5*4.5 mm) and vascular density with the foveal avascular zone in the central macula (3.0*3.0 mm) were measured and analyzed before, immediately after and 30 minutes after cigarette smoking. Quantitative measurements were carried out by AngioAnalytics Phase 7 software. Immediately after smoking both heart rate and blood pressure increased significantly (p < 0.001) compared to values before smoking and then significantly decreased after 30 minutes comparing to values obtained right after smoking (p < 0.001). The mean area of the foveal avascular zone, parafoveal vessel density, and peripapillary vessel density did not change significantly. Our results show no immediate influence of smoking on vessel density parameters measured by specific OCTA machine in healthy habitual smokers.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31308472	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308472	smoking	-9194572880052200111

Sheep pox is a disease of veterinary concern to small ruminant producers and veterinary diagnosticians, because of the associated tangible economic losses. The epidemiological analysis of sheep pox, among vaccinated sheep flock in Algeria from 2007 to 2016, showed that the disease outbreaks occurred every year and across all Algeria region with an average of 44.9 outbreaks per year, these outbreaks correlate with the region climate, the flocks' density and the transhumance practices. The one-year post vaccination antibody kinetics evaluation study of the commercially used vaccine in Algeria demonstrated a mild humoral response, the neutralization index range between 0.73 and 1.22. Therefore, the present study recommends a challenge study, using a virulent local strain, to evaluate the vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, quality control approach for the vaccine production processes is required.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31300101	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300101	vaccine	-3900870368325485697

The bark is used in folk remedies for the treatment of diarrhea, vomiting, fever and inflammation. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disease accompanied by itching. It is a complex disease involving environmental factors and genetic factors. In the present study, the anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects of C. odorata L. methanol extract (COEE) on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ-stimulated HaCaT keratinocyte cells were investigated. ELISA and RT-PCR analysis revealed that the extract had anti-inflammatory effects, and reduced the interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 levels of the HaCaT cells. In addition, COEE exhibited anti-allergic effects, comprising a reduction in the thymus and activation-regulated chemokine and macrophage-derived chemokine levels. In addition, pathway analysis and comparison with Bay11-7082 indicated that these effects are due to the inhibition of nuclear factor (NF)-κB in TNF-α/IFN-γ-induced HaCaT cells. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that COEE has anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic properties in TNF-α and IFN-γ-stimulated HaCaT cells, which are associated with the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines via the NF-κB pathway.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Greece	31281457	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31281457	Diarrhea	-5829402940194444779

Related to a broader context of historical oppression, Indigenous peoples of the USA are overburdened with the mental health challenges that social workers tend to treat, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, suicide and substance use disorders (SUD). The purpose of this systematic review is to use the Framework of Historical Oppression, Resilience and Transcendence (FHORT) to identify empirical research on risk and protective factors related to mental health and SUD amongst these populations. This systematic review includes peer-reviewed quantitative and qualitative research articles from 1980 to 2017 focusing on the mental health of US Indigenous adults. A total of thirty-eight peer-reviewed empirical articles met inclusion criteria. Results reveal adults within Indigenous populations are at a high risk for mental health outcomes, including PTSD, depression, suicide, SUD and comorbidity across these outcomes. Underlying risk factors across outcomes included historical oppression and loss, family problems and SUD. Protective factors tended to include family and social support and engagement with tribal cultural activities. Significant variability was identified based on gender and geographic regions. Given that protective factors tended to include cultural, familial and community tenets, holistic approaches are the most promising programmes for social workers to work towards.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31308574	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308574	depression	-3660106964555224100

The Antibody Mediated Prevention efficacy trials are the first studies to evaluate whether passive administration of a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody can prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition. The trials randomize 4600 HIV-negative volunteers to receive 10 infusions of the monoclonal antibody VRC01 or placebo. The primary objective compares the incidence of HIV infection between the study groups. The secondary objective assesses whether and how a marker defined as the serum concentration of VRC01 over time associates with the instantaneous rate of HIV infection, using a two-phase sampling design, a pharmacokinetic model for the time-concentration curve, and an estimator of HIV infection times. While a Cox model with a time-dependent covariate constitutes an important approach to this problem, the low interindividual versus intraindividual marker variability limits its power, motivating us to develop two alternative methods that condition on outcome status: (1) an indirect method that checks whether HIV-infected cases have unexpectedly long times from the most recent infusion to the estimated infection date and (2) a direct method that checks whether the marker itself is unexpectedly low at estimated infection dates. In simulations and a pseudo Antibody Mediated Prevention application, we find that method (2) (but not (1)) has greater power than the Cox model. We also find that the quality of the infection time estimator majorly impacts method performance, and thus, incorporating details of an optimized estimator is critical. The methods apply more generally for assessing a time-dependent longitudinal marker as a correlate of risk when the marker trajectory is modeled pharmacokinetically.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31313349	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313349	HIV	2952636544547704346

This meta-analysis aimed to assess the salivary and serum concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients compared to the controls. Four electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) were searched up to January 2019. The study quality was checked according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The mean difference (MD) plus 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated using RevMan 5.3 software. The publication bias and sensitivity analysis were done using CMA 2.0 software. Out of 309 studies retrieved from the 4 databases, 26 studies were analyzed in the present meta-analysis. In this meta-analysis, the pooled MD in the OSCC patients compared to the controls was 19.06 pg/mL (95%CI: 14.78-23.33) for the serum IL-6 level, 199.14 pg/mL (95%CI: 47.39-350.89) for the serum IL-8 level, 122 pg/mL (95%CI: 64-179) for the salivary IL-6 level, and 958 pg/dL (95%CI: 718-1197) for the salivary IL-8 level. All values in this meta-analysis were statistically significant. In conclusion, according to the meta-analysis results, the serum and salivary IL-6 and IL-8 levels in OSCC patients were significantly elevated compared to the controls, and both cytokines can be useful as potential biomarkers in early OSCC diagnosis.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31314647	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314647	cancer	-2323511129839590090

Detection of biomarkers in complex samples is a significant health plan strategy for medical diagnosis, therapy monitoring and health management. However, high background noise resulted from impurities and other analytes in complex samples has hampered the improvement of detection sensitivity and accuracy. Herein, an ultralow background biochip based on time-gated luminescent probes supported by photonic crystals (PCs) was successfully developed for detection of BC-related miRNA biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity in urine samples. Coupled with the time-gated luminescence of long-lifetime luminescence probes and the luminescence-enhanced capability of PCs, the short-lived autofluorescence can be efficiently removed, thus the detection sensitivity will be significantly improved. Benefiting from these merits, a detection limit of 26.3 fM is achieved. Furthermore, the biochip exhibits excellent performance in urinary miRNA detection and good recoveries are also obtained. The developed biochip possesses unique properties of ultralow background and luminescence enhancement, thus offering a suitable tool for the detection of BC-related miRNA in urine. With rational design of probe sequences, the biochip holds great potential for many other biomarkers in real patient samples, making it valuable in the areas such as medical diagnosis and disease evaluation.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31313911	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313911	cancer	-9033346036688923648

Besides, (E)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)hept-4-en-3-one showed to be promising as AChEI/BChEI. As before we also mapped the binding of the studied compounds on the different binding pockets inside HssBChE and established the preferred interactions to be favored in the design of new and more efficient inhibitors.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31304886	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304886	Alzheimer	6716649347760033969
2956	2956	264	Nature communications	The nasal methylome as a biomarker of asthma and airway inflammation in children.	The nasal cellular epigenome may serve as biomarker of airway disease and environmental response. Here we collect nasal swabs from the anterior nares of 547 children (mean-age 12.9 y), and measure DNA methylation (DNAm) with the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We perform nasal Epigenome-Wide Association analyses (EWAS) of current asthma, allergen sensitization, allergic rhinitis, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and lung function. We find multiple differentially methylated CpGs (FDR < 0.05) and Regions (DMRs; ≥ 5-CpGs and FDR < 0.05) for asthma (285-CpGs), FeNO (8,372-CpGs; 191-DMRs), total IgE (3-CpGs; 3-DMRs), environment IgE (17-CpGs; 4-DMRs), allergic asthma (1,235-CpGs; 7-DMRs) and bronchodilator response (130-CpGs). Discovered DMRs annotated to genes implicated in allergic asthma, Th2 activation and eosinophilia (EPX, IL4, IL13) and genes previously associated with asthma and IgE in EWAS of blood (ACOT7, SLC25A25). Asthma, IgE and FeNO were associated with nasal epigenetic age acceleration. The nasal epigenome is a sensitive biomarker of asthma, allergy and airway inflammation.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31300640	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300640	asthma	2508620055362300376
2957	2957	46	AIDS care	HIV and employment among Black men who have sex with men in Baltimore.	Employment status is a key social determinant of health, and many populations in the United States that are impacted by HIV have unequal access to education and employment opportunities which contributes to HIV-related disparities. Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are one of the groups most heavily burdened by HIV. With improved health outcomes associated with advancements in HIV treatment, research suggests that more people living with HIV want to work. This study describes employment among BMSM living in Baltimore, assesses differences in employment by HIV status and assesses predictors of full-time employment among BMSM. The study found that BMSM have limited access to full-time employment and that this disparity is even more pronounced among BMSM living with HIV. Men living with HIV were less likely to be employed full-time compared to men not living with HIV controlling for education and social contextual factors (OR 0.40 95% CI (0.22-0.73)). HIV will most likely have important implications for employment patterns and trajectories of BMSM over the life course. Additional research is needed among BMSM living with HIV to understand work histories and experiences, facilitating factors, and the impact of various work experiences on the health and wellbeing.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31311286	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311286	HIV	-9039021554659316935
2958	2958	203	 	Pregnancy Characteristics and Women’s Cardiovascular Health	Growing evidence indicates that women with a history of common pregnancy complications, including fetal growth restriction and preterm delivery (often combined as low birth weight), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and gestational diabetes are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease later in life. Here we review the associations of parity and these four pregnancy complications with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and the role of cardiovascular risk factors before, during, and after pregnancy complications in explaining these associations. We explore the implications of these findings for research in life course health science and policy intended to avoid or mitigate these pregnancy-related effects. Findings suggest consistent and often strong associations of pregnancy complications with latent and future cardiovascular disease. Many pregnancy complications appear to be preceded by subclinical vascular and metabolic dysfunction, suggesting that the complications may be useful markers of latent high-risk cardiovascular trajectories. Pregnancy complications may be useful in identifying high-risk women, at a relatively early stage in their life course for screening, prevention, and treatment of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among women.	2019	eng	Review	 	31314294	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314294	diabetes	2321412363020240814

2960	2960	105	PLoS pathogens	Similarities and differences between native HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein trimers and stabilized soluble trimer mimetics.	The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer is located on the surface of the virus and is the target of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Recombinant native-like soluble Env trimer mimetics, such as SOSIP trimers, have taken a central role in HIV-1 vaccine research aimed at inducing bNAbs. We therefore performed a direct and thorough comparison of a full-length unmodified Env trimer containing the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail, with the sequence matched soluble SOSIP trimer, both based on an early Env sequence (AMC011) from an HIV+ individual that developed bNAbs. The structures of the full-length AMC011 trimer bound to either bNAb PGT145 or PGT151 were very similar to the structures of SOSIP trimers. Antigenically, the full-length and SOSIP trimers were comparable, but in contrast to the full-length trimer, the SOSIP trimer did not bind at all to non-neutralizing antibodies, most likely as a consequence of the intrinsic stabilization of the SOSIP trimer. Furthermore, the glycan composition of full-length and SOSIP trimers was similar overall, but the SOSIP trimer possessed slightly less complex and less extensively processed glycans, which may relate to the intrinsic stabilization as well as the absence of the membrane tether. These data provide insights into how to best use and improve membrane-associated full-length and soluble SOSIP HIV-1 Env trimers as immunogens.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31306470	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306470	HIV	-7047448754687279385

Efficacy and safety of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to intracranial artery dissection (IAD) are currently not established. We aimed to present a single-center experience on IAD-related AIS treated by IVT. We selected all consecutive patients with IAD-related AIS treated by IVT from a prospectively constructed single-center acute stroke registry from 2003 to 2017. We reviewed demographical, clinical and neuroimaging data and recorded hemorrhagic complications, mortality within 7 days and modified Rankin Scale at 3-months. Out of 181 AISs related to cervicocephalic dissections, 10 (5.5%) were due to IAD and five of these patients received IVT. Among these five patients, median age was 62 years; hypertension and dyslipidemia were the most frequent vascular risk factors. IAD locations were distal internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery (M1), anterior cerebral artery (A2), and, in two cases, the basilar artery. All anterior circulation IADs were occlusive or subocclusive, while the two basilar artery IADs caused arterial stenosis. After IVT, there were no subarachnoid or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages. One patient had an asymptomatic hemorrhagic infarct type 1. Two patients died within 7 days from ischemic mass effect. The other three patients had favorable clinical outcomes at 3-months. In this small single-center case series of IAD-related AIS, thrombolysis seemed relatively safe. However, IVT efficacy and the likelihood of arterial recanalization are still uncertain in this context. Further studies are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of IVT in these patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31302824	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302824	stroke	-6742146164569753679

This review discusses the recent development in our understanding of the cell-intrinsic actions of biological factors linked to sex, sex hormones and sex chromosome complement, on immune cells, which may account for the sex differences in the enhanced susceptibility of women to develop immunological disorders, such as allergic asthma or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We choose to more specifically discuss the impact of sex hormones on the development and function of immune cell populations directly involved in type-2 immunity, and the role of the X-linked Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7) in anti-viral immunity and in SLE. We will also elaborate on the recent evidence demonstrating that TLR7 escapes from X chromosome inactivation in the immune cells of women, and how this may contribute to endow woman immune system with enhanced responsiveness to RNA-virus and susceptibility to SLE.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31296302	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296302	asthma	3382795524953511662

Nevertheless, cognitive disorders are often not systematically evaluated, especially during hospital stays for other reasons; however, cognitive impairment is associated with a number of geriatric syndromes, including falls, delirium, dysphagia and lack of adherence to treatment plans. This article considers the current state of diagnosis and treatment of dementia. Non-pharmacological therapeutic approaches as well as current and future pharmacological treatment options are discussed. The drugs of choice for the symptomatic treatment of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson-associated dementia are cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine; there is no specific pharmacological treatment for other types of dementia.

Changes in histone acetylation and methylation status with aging affect gene expression and phenotype in several tissues; however, age-related changes in histone modification in the skeletal muscle have not been elucidated yet. This study investigated age-related global changes in histone modification in rat gastrocnemius muscle. Male Wistar rats (n = 28) were assigned to one of four age groups (n = 7 per group) corresponding to different life stages: 3 months old (3-mo; young), 6 months old (adult), 12 months old (12-mo; middle-aged), and 24 months old (24-mo; old). The gastrocnemius muscle was removed and global histone modification (acetylation and tri-methylation) at K9 and K27 was evaluated by western blotting. Relative muscle mass decreased in the 12- and 24-mo rats accompanied with reduction in type IIb myosin heavy chain isoforms and Myh4 (MHC IIB) mRNA expression. Histone H3 acetylation decreased in an age-dependent manner, with lower levels in 12- and 24-mo groups than in the 3-mo group. K9 and K27 acetylation decreased with age. Although there was no significant change in K27 tri-methylation, K9 tri-methylation showed an age-dependent decline. Histone modification status (acetylation at K9 and K27 and tri-methylation at K9) was positively associated with relative gastrocnemius muscle weight, the percentage of type IIb myosin heavy chain isoform, myosin heavy chain type IIb protein expression, and the level of Myh4 mRNA. Thus, global histone H3 methylation and acetylation decrease with age, and the latter might be associated with age-related muscle atrophy of rat gastrocnemius muscle.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31302168	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31302168	aging	1496653703915349161
2982	2982	735	Statistics in medicine	A hypothesis testing procedure for random changepoint mixed models.	In biomedical research, random changepoint mixed models are used to take into account an individual breakpoint in a biomarker trajectory. This may be observed in the cognitive decline measured by psychometric tests in the prediagnosis phase of Alzheimer's disease. The existence, intensity and duration of this accelerated decline can depend on individual characteristics. The main objective of our work is to propose inferential methods to assess the existence of this phase of accelerated decline, ie, the existence of a random changepoint. To do so, we use a mixed model with two linear phases and test the nullity of the parameter measuring the difference of slopes between the two phases. Because we face the issue of nuisance parameters being unidentifiable under the null hypothesis, the supremum of the classic score test statistic on these parameters is used. The asymptotic distribution of the supremum under the null is approached with a perturbation method based on the multiplier bootstrap. The performance of our testing procedure is assessed via simulations and the test is applied to the French cohort PAQUID of elderly subjects to study the shape of the prediagnosis decline according to educational level. The test is significant for both educational levels and the estimated trajectories confirmed that educational level is a good marker for cognitive reserve.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31206731	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31206731	Alzheimer	6070279813975953742

The 2014 British Thoracic Society (BTS) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to asthma management. We investigated the management of asthma in primary care in the UK to understand how real-world practice compares with BTS/SIGN guidelines. Asthma patients were identified from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink from September 2006 to August 2016. Aims were to classify patients according to BTS/SIGN steps, describe the proportion of patients transitioning between steps and describe patient demographics and clinical characteristics per group. Overall, 647,308 patients with asthma were identified (40,096 aged 5-11 years; 607,212 aged 12-80 years). Most treated patients were in step 1 or 2 (88.3% of children/67.5% of adults in December 2007; 83.0% of children/67.0% of adults in June 2016). Most patients remained within their treatment step within a 6-month interval (>78% of children and adults throughout the study duration). The proportion of patients stepping up and down reduced from the beginning of the study, although stepping down to step 1 was relatively common in both adults and children. Few patients had a recorded asthma review in the year before reference date (18.8% of children and 14.8% of adults). Although prescribing patterns meant that most patients remained within their treatment step throughout the study, we cannot be sure that this was because their disease was truly stable. The small proportion of patients stepping up/down and the lack of recorded asthma review suggest that patients may not be treated in accordance with BTS/SIGN guidelines.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31296867	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31296867	asthma	7775857588929395558

Small pulmonary nodules are most often managed by surveillance imaging with chest computed tomography (CT), but the optimal frequency and duration of surveillance are unknown. The Watch the Spot Trial is a multi-center, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial with cluster randomization by hospital or health system that compares more vs. less intensive strategies for active surveillance of small pulmonary nodules. The study plans to enroll approximately 35,200 patients with a small pulmonary nodule that is newly detected on chest CT, either incidentally or by screening. Study protocols for more and less intensive surveillance were adapted from published guidelines. The primary outcome is the percentage of cancerous nodules that progress beyond American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition (AJCC 7) stage T1aN0M0. Secondary outcomes include patient-reported anxiety and emotional distress, nodule-related health care utilization, radiation exposure, and adherence with the assigned surveillance protocol.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is the fastest-growing indication for the liver transplant and a leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma among patients listed for liver transplantation in the USA. Post-transplant nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis are frequent complications of liver transplantation. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis poses a significant challenge in both pre- and post-transplant period due to its association with metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. While optimal therapy is not yet available in the post-liver transplant setting, lifestyle interventions continue to remain as the mainstay of therapy for post-transplant nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Early recognition with protocol biopsies and noninvasive modalities, along with modification of known risk factors, are the most effective methods to curtail the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in the absence of FDA-approved pharmacologic therapy.	2019	eng	Review	United States	31312990	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312990	obesity	-44082375822273498

3004	3004	323	Vaccine	Effective mosaic-based nanovaccines against avian influenza in poultry.	"Avian influenza virus (AIV) is an extraordinarily diverse pathogen that causes significant morbidity in domesticated poultry populations and threatens human life with looming pandemic potential. Controlling avian influenza in susceptible populations requires highly effective, economical and broadly reactive vaccines. Several AIV vaccines have proven insufficient despite their wide use, and better technologies are needed to improve their immunogenicity and broaden effectiveness. Previously, we developed a ""mosaic"" H5 subtype hemagglutinin (HA) AIV vaccine and demonstrated its broad protection against diverse highly pathogenic H5N1 and seasonal H1N1 virus strains in mouse and non-human primate models. There is a significant interest in developing effective and safe vaccines against AIV that cannot contribute to the emergence of new strains of the virus once circulating in poultry. Here, we report on the development of an H5 mosaic (H5M) vaccine antigen formulated with polyanhydride nanoparticles (PAN) that provide sustained release of encapsulated antigens. H5M vaccine constructs were immunogenic whether delivered by the modified virus Ankara (MVA) strain or encapsulated within PAN. Both humoral and cellular immune responses were generated in both specific-pathogen free (SPF) and commercial chicks. Importantly, chicks vaccinated by H5M constructs were protected in terms of viral shedding from divergent challenge with a low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) strain at 8 weeks post-vaccination. In addition, protective levels of humoral immunity were generated against highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) of the similar H5N1 and genetically dissimilar H5N2 viruses. Overall, the developed platform technologies (MVA vector and PAN encapsulation) were safe and provided high levels of sustained protection against AIV in chickens. Such approaches could be used to design more efficacious vaccines against other important poultry infections."	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31300285	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300285	vaccine	896159636285333275

The clinical characteristics of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in patients with immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (HIV-PCP) differ from those in patients without HIV infection (non-HIV-PCP). We analyzed 31 adult HIV-PCP cases and 44 non-HIV-PCP cases between 2008 and 2018. The symptomatic period before the diagnosis was shorter in non-HIV-PCP (5 [3-8] days vs. 29 [14-55] days, P < 0.001) and the overall survival rate was lower in the non-HIV-PCP group (P = 0.022). Serum β-D glucan positivity (72.7% vs. 93.5%, P = 0.034) and Grocott stain positivity for Pneumocystis jirovecii in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (4.3% vs. 73.3%, P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the non-HIV-PCP group. This difficulty in laboratory diagnosis possibly resulted in the administration of concurrent antibiotics such as quinolones and macrolides (56.8% vs. 19.4% P = 0.002) in the non-HIV-PCP group. The adverse effects due to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were more frequently observed in HIV-PCP (86.2% vs. 35.3%, P < 0.001). The duration of discontinuation of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was 11 [8-14.5] days in HIV-PCP cases. Co-administration of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy did not mitigate hypersensitivity to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Our analysis indicated that the characteristics of PCP in patients with or without HIV was quite different. HIV-positive patients with PCP should be monitored closely to avoid adverse effects due to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Because positivity polymerase chain reaction test for P. jirovecii remained high (91.7%), it is suggested that bronchofiberscopy is warranted for diagnosis of PCP in HIV-negative patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Netherlands	31300379	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300379	HIV	8153556216916362816

Reflections on Meiser-Stedman et al. (2019).	Children all over the world experience exposure to trauma. Why do only some young people have significant traumatic stress symptoms in the days and weeks immediately post-trauma while others do not, and why do some youth then recover without treatment while others go on to suffer from persistent PTSD? This important question is examined in a comprehensive study by Meiser-Stedman et al., (2019). In a sample of single-event trauma exposed youth, they investigate the role cognitive processes may have in shaping early reactions and in maintaining post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) over time. For the onset of PTSS, perceived threat and feeling overwhelmed and confused during the traumatic event was associated with significant PTSS. For the maintenance of PTSS, poorly elaborated, sensory-based memories, dissociation, rumination, and negative appraisals were associated with higher PTSS. The newly revised International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies' guidelines for the prevention and treatment of PTSS found no strong evidence to recommend any of the evaluated preventive or early intervention programs. This commentary highlights how understanding different trajectories for the onset and maintenance of post-traumatic stress may inform our development of prevention and early intervention strategies. Cognitive processes seem to play an important role in the development of PTSS but these may play out differently in youth exposed to single events and youth with interpersonal trauma experiences. Knowledge on memory processing, meaning making, the role of social support and maladaptive cognitions need to be implemented in systems of trauma-informed care.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31313840	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313840	stress	1469580151036142903

A 74-year- old male, who was known to have hypertension, chronic obstructive lung disease, and benign prostate hyperplasia, was evaluated preoperatively in our clinic for a femur fracture. In addition, it was found that the patient was using 1000 mg of metformin per oral due to type 2 diabetes. At the preoperative cardiology evaluation, the ejection fraction was 60% with normal systolic ventricular function. Routine laboratory tests were normal. Metformin was held 24 hours before surgery. Spinal anesthesia was applied with 10 mg bupivacaine and 20 mcg fentanyl. Total blood loss at surgery was 150 cc. After an uneventful surgery, the patient was observed at the surgical postanesthesia care unit. Cardiac and respiratory physical examinations seemed normal but the patient had minimal acidosis and hypoxia in the arterial blood gas analysis. Twelve hours after the operation, compensated high anion gap ( 30 mEq/l) metabolic acidosis emerged, but lactate was normal. The patient's urea and creatinine levels were normal in the control blood tests, and the patient's urine output was above 0.5 ml/kg. Within this period, glucose levels were around 80-140 mg/dl. To overcome metabolic acidosis, bolus intravenous 8.4 % bicarbonate solution was administered. Bicarbonate infusion was started on the continuation of metabolic acidosis and base loss despite the bolus bicarbonate treatment. Since there was no other reason for the metabolic acidosis, metformin usage was considered to cause metabolic acidosis. During this treatment period, despite high anion gap acidosis, there was no lactate elevation. The patient had normal laboratory and hemodynamic values and was discharged from the intensive care unit at postoperative Day 3.	2019	eng	Case Reports	United States	31309009	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309009	diabetes	8729086959762650511

Adolescent-produced anti-substance use messaging is an increasingly popular and effective prevention strategy. However, little is known about the content of these messages and the production elements adolescents use to bring that content to life. In this article, we present a content analysis of 95 anti-substance use messages developed by 4-H club members across nine U.S. states as part of their participation in the media literacy program REAL media. Posters and videos were content-analyzed for target substance, prevention goal, message form, message content, persuasion strategies, and production elements. Results of the content analysis revealed that combustible tobacco (smoking) was the most popular target substance in the sample among the choices of alcohol, marijuana, e-cigarettes, and chewing tobacco. More youth developed messages with the goal of preventing substance use, rather than stopping current use. Slogans were used in the majority of messages, and nearly all messages took an informational form, rather than narrative or statistical form. Persuasion strategies covered in the curriculum, including fun with the group, unexpected, style, and endorsement were scantily used.

Homocysteine [HSCH2CH2CH(NH2)COOH] (Hcy), is a sulfur-containing amino acid of 135.18 Da of molecular weight, generated during conversion of methionine to cysteine. If there is a higher accumulation of Hcy in the blood, i.e. usually above 15 µmol/L, it leads to a condition referred to as hyperhomocysteinemia. A meta-analysis of observational study suggested an elevated concentration of Hcy in blood, which is termed as the risk factors leading to ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke. Further experimental studies stated that Hcy can lead to an increase in the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and functional impairment of endothelial cells. The analyses confirmed some of the predictors for Hcy presence, such as serum uric acid (UA), systolic blood pressure, and hematocrit. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ARBs) (except losartan) alone are inadequate for controlling UA and creatinine level, although the addition of folic acid may be beneficial in hypertensive patients who are known to have a high prevalence of elevated Hcy. We hypothesized that combination therapy with an ARB (olmesartan) and folic acid is a promising treatment for lowering the UA and creatinine level in hyperhomocysteinemia associated hypertension.

3026	3026	712	The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society	Ethnic distinctions in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes: a focus on black African-Caribbean populations.	Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global public health priority, particularly for populations of black African-Caribbean ethnicity, who suffer disproportionately high rates of the disease. While the mechanisms underlying the development of T2D are well documented, there is growing evidence describing distinctions among black African-Caribbean populations. In the present paper, we review the evidence describing the impact of black African-Caribbean ethnicity on T2D pathophysiology. Ethnic differences were first recognised through evidence that metabolic syndrome diagnostic criteria fail to detect T2D risk in black populations due to less central obesity and dyslipidaemia. Subsequently more detailed investigations have recognised other mechanistic differences, particularly lower visceral and hepatic fat accumulation and a distinctly hyperinsulinaemic response to glucose stimulation. While epidemiological studies have reported exaggerated insulin resistance in black populations, more detailed and direct measures of insulin sensitivity have provided evidence that insulin sensitivity is not markedly different to other ethnic groups and does not explain the hyperinsulinaemia that is exhibited. These findings lead us to hypothesise that ectopic fat does not play a pivotal role in driving insulin resistance in black populations. Furthermore, we hypothesise that hyperinsulinaemia is driven by lower rates of hepatic insulin clearance rather than heightened insulin resistance and is a primary defect rather than occurring in compensation for insulin resistance. These hypotheses are being investigated in our ongoing South London Diabetes and Ethnicity Phenotyping study, which will enable a more detailed understanding of ethnic distinctions in the pathophysiology of T2D between men of black African and white European ethnicity.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31307560	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307560	obesity	2277184202014276839

Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a major complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), responsible for skeletal and vascular damage with increased risk of bone fractures, cardiovascular events, and mortality. However, the optimal serum parathormone (PTH) levels for improving clinical outcomes remain uncertain. Treatment of SHPT is based on nutritional therapy, phosphate binders, vitamin D, and calcimimetics, but none of these interventions has ever been tested against placebo in randomized controlled trials. Treatment of SHPT in the elderly should consider the many peculiarities of aging in terms of physiopathology, quality of life, symptoms, subjective perception of disease, drug load, and the modifying effect of treatment on disease-related outcomes. Unfortunately, peculiarities of SHPT among elderly CKD patients are mainly unexplored. The present review aims to provide a reasonable merging of evidence regarding the management of SHPT in CKD, with more actual concepts on how to care for older patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	New Zealand	31304565	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304565	aging	-5160830061297425098

Although several lines of evidence existed suggesting that Mortalin was linked with survival in malignant tumors; it has been barely described regarding the prognostic involvement of its expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, to understand the prognostic meaning of Mortalin expression, Immunohistochemistry was undertaken to observe the immunohistochemical characteristics of Mortalin on HCC tissue microarray consisting of 90 cases of HCC and its paired normal control dots, followed by detailed statistical analysis with the accompanying clinicopathological variables available, including gender, age, tumor size, differentiation, cirrhosis, vascular invasion, clinical stage, T classification and intrahepatic metastases. Meanwhile, Kaplan-Meier survival curve was plotted to analyze the prognostic difference for patients with high and low expression of Mortalin. It was exhibited that Mortalin was over-expressed in HCC tissues relative to paired normal control and elevated Mortalin significantly correlated with vascular invasion, clinical stage and intrahepatic metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that Mortalin was remarkably associated with overall survival and disease-free survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that expression of Mortalin was an independent prognostic factor in HCC. Collectively, the data we provided here support the prognostic prediction value of Mortalin in HCC.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31310900	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310900	Cirrhosis	-6872546942144599345

Approximately 3% of the world population suffers from depression, which is one of the most common form of mental disorder. Recent findings suggest that an interaction between the nervous system and immune system might be behind the pathophysiology of various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including depression. Neuropeptides have been shown to play a major role in mediating response to stress and inducing immune activation or suppression. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is a major regulator of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis response. CRF is a stress-related neuropeptide whose dysregulation has been associated with depression. In this review, we summarized the role of CRF in the neuroimmune mechanisms of depression, and the potential therapeutic effects of Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) as well as other agents. Studying the network of CRF and immune responses will help to enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of depression. Additionally, targeting this important network may aid in developing novel treatments for this debilitating psychiatric disorder.	2019	eng	Journal Article	Switzerland	31312123	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312123	depression	7631327570702153011

Given chronic experiences of historical oppression, Indigenous peoples tend to experience much higher rates of depression than the general US population, which then, drives disproportionately high rates of suicide and other health disparities. The purpose of this research was to examine the core components of the culturally grounded Framework of Historical Oppression, Resilience, and Transcendence as they relate to depressive symptoms experienced by Indigenous peoples. As part of a larger convergent mixed-methods study, in this quantitative survey component, we utilised data from a sample of 127 Indigenous adults across two Southeastern US tribes. Regression analysis results signified support for the framework, indicating that historical oppression and proximal stress (daily stressors and lower incomes) were risk factors, whereas family resilience and life satisfaction (a measure of transcendence) were protective factors related to depressive symptoms. The results provide a foundation for future research to build upon in identifying culturally relevant risk and protective factors to ameliorate depression and other health disparities.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31308575	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308575	depression	-7264217791213422584

After Alzheimer, Parkinson disease (PD) is the most frequently occurring progressive, degenerative neurological disease. It affects both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems in a variable fashion. Cardiovascular symptoms are present in almost all stages of PD and narrower heart rate variability is the earliest sign. Administration of Levodopa to PD patients has proven to provide some degree of neurological protection. This drug, however, causes side effects including nausea and vomiting, lessened by the administration of domperidone. Autopsies in PD patients led some researchers to suggest the involvement of the ventricular arrhythmia induced by domperidone. The aim of the present study was to determine the impact of the adjusted human maximal dose of domperidone, on cardiological features of Wistar rats. domperidone was administered to both 6-hydroxydopamine Parkinsonism models and regular Wistar rats. Quantitative analysis of ranges of heart beat variation showed significant abnormal distribution in both groups receiving domperidone as compared with respective sham counterparts. However, qualitative analysis of Poincaré plots showed that 6-hydroxydopamine Parkinsonism models receiving domperidone had the narrowest full range of heart beat and the worst distribution heart beat ranges as compared with all study groups corroborating with previous suggestion that domperidone administration to PD patients is likely to play a role in sudden unexpected death in this group of patients.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31222185	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31222185	Alzheimer	-8591127493017117985

The study of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) has provided important clues to decipher mechanisms underlying aging. Progerin, a mutant lamin A, disrupts nuclear envelope structure/function, with further impairment of multiple processes that culminate in senescence. Here, we demonstrate that the nuclear protein export pathway is exacerbated in HGPS, due to progerin-driven overexpression of CRM1, thereby disturbing nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of CRM1-target proteins. Enhanced nuclear export is central in HGPS, since pharmacological inhibition of CRM1 alleviates all aging hallmarks analyzed, including senescent cellular morphology, lamin B1 downregulation, loss of heterochromatin, nuclear morphology defects, and expanded nucleoli. Exogenous overexpression of CRM1 on the other hand recapitulates the HGPS cellular phenotype in normal fibroblasts. CRM1 levels/activity increases with age in fibroblasts from healthy donors, indicating that altered nuclear export is a common hallmark of pathological and physiological aging. Collectively, our findings provide novel insights into HGPS pathophysiology, identifying CRM1 as potential therapeutic target in HGPS.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31305018	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31305018	aging	-3201623914150480647

We have also shown that downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, reduce submucosal edema, attenuation of proinflammatory cell infiltration, inhibition of oxidative stress, decrease in excessive collagen deposition, and suppression of profibrotic genes at the site of surgery are some of the mechanisms by which EW-7197 elicits its protective responses against adhesion band formation.

Background Studies on the determinants of carotid intima-media thickness ( CIMT ), a marker of sub-clinical atherosclerosis, mostly come from white, Asian, and diasporan black populations. We present CIMT data from sub-Saharan Africa, which is experiencing a rising burden of cardiovascular diseases and infectious diseases. Methods and Results The H3 (Human Hereditary and Health) in Africa's AWI-Gen (African-Wits-INDEPTH partnership for Genomic) study is a cross-sectional study conducted in adults aged 40 to 60 years from Burkina Faso, Kenya, Ghana, and South Africa. Cardiovascular disease risk and ultrasonography of the CIMT of right and left common carotids were measured. Multivariable linear and mixed-effect multilevel regression modeling was applied to determine factors related to CIMT. Data included 8872 adults (50.8% men), mean age of 50±6 years with age- and sex-adjusted mean (±SE) CIMT of 640±123μm. Participants from Ghana and Burkina Faso had higher CIMT compared with other sites. Age (β = 6.77, 95%CI [6.34-7.19]), body mass index (17.6[12.5-22.8]), systolic blood pressure (7.52[6.21-8.83]), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (5.08[2.10-8.06]) and men (10.3[4.75- 15.9]) were associated with higher CIMT. Smoking was associated with higher CIMT in men. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-12.2 [-17.9- -6.41]), alcohol consumption (-13.5 [-19.1--7.91]) and HIV (-8.86 [-15.7--2.03]) were inversely associated with CIMT. Conclusions Given the rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases risk factors in sub-Saharan Africa, atherosclerotic diseases may become a major pan-African epidemic unless preventive measures are taken particularly for prevention of hypertension, obesity, and smoking. HIV -specific studies are needed to fully understand the association between HIV and CIMT in sub-Saharan Africa.	2019	eng	Journal Article	England	31304842	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31304842	smoking	-3295913657316686039

Twelve new Cyclophostin and Cyclipostins analogs (CyC19-30) were synthesized, thus extending our series to 38 CyCs. Their antibacterial activities were evaluated against four pathogenic mycobacteria (Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium marinum, Mycobacterium bovis BCG and Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and two Gram negative bacteria. The CyCs displayed very low toxicity towards host cells and were only active against mycobacteria. Importantly, several CyCs were active against extracellular M. abscessus (CyC17/CyC18β/CyC25/CyC26) or intramacrophage residing mycobacteria (CyC7(α,β)/CyC8(α,β)) with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC50) values comparable to or better than those of amikacin or imipenem, respectively. An activity-based protein profiling combined with mass spectrometry allowed identification of the potential target enzymes of CyC17/CyC26, mostly being involved in lipid metabolism and/or in cell wall biosynthesis. Overall, these results strengthen the selective activity of the CyCs against mycobacteria, including the most drug-resistant M. abscessus, through the cumulative inhibition of a large number of Ser- and Cys-enzymes participating in key physiological processes.	2019	eng	Journal Article	United States	31299146	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299146	tuberculosis	3618271604906293310
